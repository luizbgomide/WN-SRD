# Major Projects

In any campaign, there will likely arise some occasion when the
PCs take it into their heads to accomplish some great change in the
world. Perhaps they want to abolish slavery in a country, or institute
a new government in a howling wilderness, or crush the economic
power of a hateful merchant cartel. The party wants to accomplish
something grand or large-scale where there is no obvious direct path
to success. No single killing or specific act of heroism will get them
their aim, though the goal itself isn’t so wild as to be obviously futile.

Such ambitions are major projects, and this section will cover a
simple system to help the GM adjudicate their progress and success.
This system is meant to handle sprawling, ambiguous ambitions that
aren’t clearly susceptible to a simple solution. If the party wants a
dead town burgomaster, then they can simply kill him. If they want
to turn his town into a major new trading nexus, something more
complicated may be required.
