# The Class List

The classes that follow are flavor-stripped versions of those found in **Worlds Without Number** and its supplement, **The Atlas of the Latter Earth**. While mainstays such as the Warrior, the Expert, or the High Mage are appropriate to almost any fantasy setting, others may not fit specific campaigns. A GM always has the right to omit classes that do not fit the flavor of the game they are running.

## The Adventurer

Not every hero is perfectly reflected by one of the three main classes,
even with the wide latitude of concepts each one allows. For those
heroes that straddle the roles, there remains the class of Adventurer.

An Adventurer picks two classes to reflect their own particular
talents. A spell-slinging swordsman might choose to be a Partial
Mage/Partial Warrior, while a stealthy assassin might be a Partial
Expert/Partial Warrior, and a grifting mountebank-wizard might be
a Partial Expert/Partial Mage. The player should pick whichever
pairing serves best.

The tables below provide the hit dice, attack bonus, and Foci picks
gained by each of the three possible pairings. Thus, a first level Partial
Expert/Partial Warrior would roll 1d6+2 for their hit points, have a
+1 attack bonus, and pick three Foci: one expert, one warrior, and
one free pick.

Adventurers tend to have a wider range of abilities than a more
focused PC, and the extra Focus pick can make a significant difference
at low levels. The absence of the strongest class abilities of Experts and
Warriors make a difference in the longer run, however, and a Partial
Mage will never attain the same magical power in their tradition as
a focused specialist.

### Partial Expert

A Partial Expert is treated just as a full Expert, including gaining the
benefits of the **Quick Learner** ability. They do not have the **Masterful
Expertise** ability, however, as they lack the versatility of a full Expert.

### Partial Mage
A Partial Mage is treated as a Mage, and gains the **Arcane Tradition**
ability, allowing them to pick a magical tradition for their powers. That
tradition’s abilities will be more limited for Partial Mages, however,
as described under each of the paths.

It’s even possible for a PC to pick the Partial Mage class twice
for two different magical traditions, gaining portions of both arcane
powers. They then use the usual full Mage chart for hit dice, attack
bonus, and Foci, and the spellcasting table for dual casters if both
partial classes cast spells.

A Partial Mage must adhere to the restrictions and limits of their
magical tradition in order to use its abilities, regardless of whatever
other partial class they may have.

### Partial Warrior

A Partial Warrior gains certain of the benefits of a full Warrior, including the improved hit die and a somewhat improved attack bonus.
They do not have the **Veteran’s Luck** special ability or the **Killing Blow** power, however, and must trust to their own talents to land
blows and crush their enemies.

## The Accursed

The Accursed are those men and women who have made pacts
with otherworldly beings, intentionally or otherwise, and gained
powers from that bond.

### Benefits of the Accursed

The Accursed is a partial Mage class that must be joined with a
second partial class by an Adventurer. A Partial Warrior/Accursed
might be a grim demonic warrior, a Partial Expert/Accursed might
be a sinister tempter, while a Partial Mage/Accursed could be a
sorcerer willing to pact with foul creatures for their powers.

All Accursed gain Magic-0 during character creation. Even
those who are not spellcasters must understand the ways of eldritch
beings and the subtleties of sorcery.

While the arts of **Accursed Blade** and **Accursed Bolt** use
Magic as their combat skill, Foci that normally apply to mundane
weapons such as Armsmaster or Deadeye also benefit their relevant
melee or ranged attacks. For these Foci, read “Magic” in place
of “Shoot” or “Stab” when gaining their benefits, including the
granted skill and the stacking damage bonus that the first level of
the Focus may grant.

### Accursed Arts

An Accursed has an Effort score equal to their Magic skill level plus
their Intelligence or Charisma modifier, to a minimum of one point.
Every Accursed gains either **Accursed Bolt** or **Accursed Blade**
as a starting art, plus one more of their choice. Accursed arts may
be used in or out of armor.

**Accursed Blade:** As an On Turn action, manifest an occult melee
weapon as a one-handed 1d8 weapon or a two-handed 2d6
weapon. Both add your Magic skill to the damage roll, have a
Shock rating of 2/15, and use Magic as the attack skill and the
best of Str, Dex, Int, or Cha as its modifying attribute.

**Accursed Bolt:** As Accursed Blade, but you launch blasts of occult
force instead of meleeing. Their damage is 1d8 plus your Magic
skill, their range is 200’, and the bolts can be thrown in melee at
a -4 penalty to hit. These bolts need both hands free to hurl them.

**Bewitching Distraction:** Commit Effort for the day as a Main
Action when talking to an intelligent target when not in combat.
They must make a Mental save or become dazed, oblivious to their
surroundings and forgetting you and all else that happened in that
scene. Danger ends the daze but not the forgetting.

**Compelling Shriek:** Once per scene, Commit Effort for the day as
a Main Action and shout a command of no more than seven words.
Chosen targets who hear and understand must make a Mental
save or perform that action for one round, provided it is not totally
contrary to their character.

**Devil’s Bargain:** As a Main Action, consecrate a deal you’ve
made with an uncoerced person. If they violate the deal or its
spirit, you know instantly and may inflict 1d6 damage per level
on them if desired.

**Dire Pact:** Foes suffer a penalty equal to your Magic skill on all
saves versus your Accursed arts. If they succeed, however, you
gain one System Strain.

**Lying Face:** Commit Effort as a Main Action; while it remains Committed, you can disguise yourself as any humanoid of the same
general size, including clothing, scent, and voice.

**Night-Black Eyes:** You can see clearly in perfect darkness. As a Main Action, focus on a particular visible object, person, or location; you can tell if it is enchanted, though no details about the
magic are seen.

**Pacted Protection:** Choose a type of harmful energy: fire, frost,
acid, electricity, or the like. You become immune to natural degrees of this energy and take half damage from magical attacks
involving it.

**Rob Vitality:** Once per scene, as an On Turn action, Commit Effort
for the scene and target a visible foe. They must make a Physical
save or lose their next Main Action, which you immediately gain
instead.

**Scourging Curse:** Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action
and target a visible foe. Your curse inflicts a -1 penalty to their hit,
damage, and saving throw rolls for one round per level. At 4th level
this penalty becomes -2, and at 9th it becomes -3. Only one such
curse can be active at a given time.

**Shadowed Steps:** As a Move Action, Commit Effort for the scene
and teleport up to your Move distance. You cannot bypass walls
or physical obstacles, but you can teleport vertically or into high
places.

**Snaring Speech:** Once per round as an Instant action, Commit
Effort for the day when failing a skill check to persuade or tempt
someone. They must make a Mental save or agree with your proposal if it’s something they would normally consider doing. Gain
one System Strain when using this art.

**Sorcerous Battery:** Once per day, as an On Turn action, Commit
Effort for the day. You or a visible ally refresh the spell slot of a
spell that has been cast since the start of the prior round. Gain one
System Strain.

**Soul Consumption:** As an Instant action, Commit Effort for the day
when you fell an intelligent target with Accursed Bolt or Accursed
Blade. They die instantly. You heal 1d6 hit points plus your level
and lose one accumulated System Strain.

**Tendrils of Night:** Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While
Committed, you exude numerous tentacles or eldritch arms that can
manipulate objects with your strength up to 20’ away. You gain no
bonus actions, but the arms can melee at range. These arms have
your AC, and you are damaged if they are hurt.

**Unseen Steps:** As an On Turn action, Commit Effort for the day to
turn invisible for 1d6 rounds plus your level. This invisibility breaks
before you attack, cast spells, or perform other vigorous or violent
actions.

**Weight of Sin:** As a Main Action, Commit Effort for the day and
target a visible foe. They must make a Physical save or lose their
Move action for 1d6 rounds plus your level.

**Weeping Wounds:** Once per round, Commit Effort for the scene
as an Instant action when a visible enemy takes damage. They
must make a Physical save or suffer 1d6 damage per round for
one round per level. They cannot heal or regenerate any hit point
damage during this effect. This art does not stack.
