# The Invoker

The Invoker is an optional spellcasting Mage class that allows a
caster to gain flexibility in casting weaker spells. In exchange, an
Invoker sacrifices arts and finds more powerful spells to be more
draining to cast.

## Invoker Benefits

All Invokers gain Magic as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0, or
level-1 if was already level-0. Their arcane versatility requires a
thorough grounding in theory.

Invokers can learn and prepare spells of the High Magic tradition, and have the same limits on casting in armor as they do. Each
Invoker can prepare a number of known spells as indicated by the
table each day, plus their Intelligence modifier.

Each Invoker has a number of spell points based on their level,
to which is added their Intelligence modifier. When they cast the
spell, they subtract its level from their available spell points for the
day. So long as they have sufficient spell points left, they can cast
the same spell repeatedly. Spell points refresh each morning.

Invokers do not normally gain arts; their versatility requires complete focus, barring those who take the Invoker-specific **Traditional Education** Focus. While it’s possible to be a Partial Invoker, this partial class may not be mixed with another partial spellcasting class.

Invokers begin play knowing four first level High Magic spells,
or two if a partial class. When they advance a level, they learn
two more of any level or tradition from which they can cast, or one
if a partial Invoker.

## Focus: Traditional Education

Your Invoker has received a great deal of education in a specialist
arcane spellcasting tradition such as High Magic arts, Elementalism
or Necromancy. Only Invokers can take this Focus, and it can only
be taken once.

**Level 1:** You may learn and prepare spells of your chosen tradition as well as those of High Magic. You gain arts as if a first level
practitioner of that tradition, full or partial based on whether you’re
a full or partial Invoker, and your maximum Effort score is equal to
your Magic skill, to a minimum of 1. You cannot gain further arts
from this tradition.
