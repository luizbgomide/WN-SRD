# The Warrior

The Warrior is a hero born to the blade, a man or woman gifted
with a superb capacity for physical violence. Savage barbarians,
hardened mercenaries, courageous young farm boys, and ordinary
laborers who just happen to have an undiscovered capacity for
massive bloodshed all might qualify as Warriors.

Warriors aren’t all formal soldiers or recognized veterans of the
blade. Any adventurer who excels in dealing with their problems
through violence might qualify as a Warrior, however peaceful their
background. It’s possible that their very talent for killing was what
forced them out of their old life after some terrible event or awful
encounter compelled them to recognize their gifts.

Warriors have more hit points than heroes of other class, and
are capable of surviving wounds and hardships that would kill an
ordinary man. They’re also gifted with a superior attack bonus, and
a native ability to inflict more damage than other PCs. Full Warriors
even have the ability to ensure a hit or force a miss by an enemy
once per scene, making them lethal foes to common combatants.

### Class Ability: Killing Blow
Whenever a Warrior inflicts damage with any attack, spell, or
special ability they may add half their character level, rounded
up, to the damage done. This damage is also added to any Shock
they may inflict.

Combined with Foci meant to improve Shock attacks such as
**Armsmaster**, **Close Combatant**, or **Shocking Assault**, this ability ensures that an experienced Warrior will almost always kill
any ordinary human soldier or minor monster, regardless of their
attack roll result.
Partial Warriors do not get this ability.

### Class Ability: Veteran’s Luck
Once per scene, as an Instant action, the Warrior may turn a missed
attack they have made into a hit. Alternately, they may turn a successful attack against them into a miss, also as an Instant action.
This ability is particularly lethal when used with the Make a Snap
Attack action and leveled against weaker monsters or ordinary
human warriors.

Only one exercise of this ability is possible in a scene, either
to force a miss or ensure a hit on a foe; both options may not be
employed in the same fight.

A Warrior may use this ability with crew-served weapons they
are assisting in firing. This ability cannot be used to negate environmental damage or damage done to a vehicle or mount they
are riding.

Partial Warriors do not get this ability.

## The Mageslayer

Mageslayers are those specialist combatants who trade a more
general proficiency in battle for certain special arts that make them
exceptionally lethal against spellcasters.

### Benefits of the Mageslayer

The Mageslayer is a partial Warrior class that must be joined with a
second partial class by an Adventurer. As no Mage class is allowed
to pair with this profession, this usually means a Partial Warrior/
Mageslayer or Partial Expert/Mageslayer.

Unlike the normal Partial Warrior class, Mageslayers do not
get a bonus combat Focus at first level, nor do they grant a Partial
Warrior’s +2 hit points per hit die. If their other Partial class is Warrior, they gain these benefits normally.

All Mageslayers gain Magic-0 during character creation. While
it cannot be used for item creation or other magical pursuits, it
allows them an intellectual understanding of their prey’s abilities.
Mageslayers gain special arts at first level and as they advance.

### Spellcasters and Spells

Many of these arts refer to “casters” and “spells”. Each of these
terms has a specific definition for Mageslayers.

A “spell” is learned power that a creature casts with the usual
spellcasting rules or an art used by a Mage class. Magical effects
created by portable magic items also count as spells, such as a
wand that hurls fiery bolts, or an amulet that conjures impenetrable
barriers.

Passive magical qualities, like the hit bonus of a magic sword, do
not count as spells, nor do magical effects created by Workings or
other large-scale edifices. Neither are a magical creature’s innate
supernatural powers or magical abilities that mimic specific spells.

A “caster” is any creature that is capable of casting spells using
the usual spellcasting rules or triggering Mage class arts, whatever
their brand of magic may be.
Potent as the Mageslayer’s arts may be, they are not strong
enough to negate magic generated by gods, demi-divinities, or
other quasi-divine entities.

### Mageslayer Arts

A Mageslayer has an Effort score equal to their Magic skill level
plus their highest attribute modifier among Intelligence and Constitution, to a minimum of one point. Mageslayer arts may be used
in or out of armor, and require no free hands, incantations, or other
overt actions, though some sects have favored prayers or oaths.

A Mageslayer gains their arts at a set rate, beginning with **Antimage** and **Magebane** at first level, and acquiring other talents
as they gain experience.

**Antimage:** Get one level of the Nullifier Focus for free, or a free Focus if you somehow have both levels.

**Magebane:** You add half your level, rounded up, to all damage you inflict on casters from any source, be it by weapon, Shock, or violent action. This does not stack with a Warrior’s Killing Blow class ability.

**Witchfinder:** As a Main Action, Commit Effort for the scene. For the rest of the scene, you gain the benefits of the Apprehend the Arcane Form spell, except for the spell’s dark-vision ability.

**Spellshield:** When a spell inflicts hit point damage on you, it’s automatically halved, rounded down, before any saves or resistances are applied.

**Disrupt Sorcery:** As an On Turn action, Commit Effort for the scene. The next attack you make that round will leave the target unable to cast spells or trigger Mage arts for the rest of the round, even if the attack misses. Currently-active arts are not disrupted. If the attack is successfully Screened by an ally, however, the target is unaffected.

**Know Your Prey:** Your Magic skill is treated as one point higher than it is, up to a maximum of level-4 skill. This benefit adds to your Effort as usual, and may allow you to have a higher Magic skill than your character level would usually allow.

**Share the Pain:** As an Instant action, Commit Effort for the day when you are targeted by a hostile spell or are in its area of effect. Make a Mental saving throw; on a success, the spell’s caster is treated as also having affected by the spell that just targeted you. This art can be used only once per round.

**Dispel Enchantment:** As a Main Action, touch an ally and Commit Effort for the day. Your touch acts as an Extirpate Arcana spell. This art can only be applied to creatures, not objects, and can be applied to yourself or a given target only once per day.

**Ward Ally:** As an Instant action, Commit Effort for the scene when an ally within thirty feet is affected by a spell; you are affected by the spell in place of your ally. If you are both in the same area of effect, the spell hits you twice. Any defenses or arts you have against sorcery may be applied as usual to this transferred effect.

**Immaculate Body:** Magical transformations, curses, or lingering negative magical penalties last a maximum of one scene on you. Such malisons cannot kill you, reducing you to 1 HP at worst. This applies to all magical effects, and not only to hostile spells.

**Immaculate Mind:** You are impervious to unwanted mind-affecting or mind-reading spells or magical effects, and you automatically see through illusions and magical invisibility. Note that this applies to all such magical effects, not merely spells.

**Absolute Negation:** As an Instant action, Commit Effort for the day when you are about to be affected or impeded by an unwanted spell or a standing magical effect created by a spell. You may ignore the magic.
