# The Expert

Your hero is an expert at some useful skill. Thieves, diplomats, healers, scholars, explorers, artisans, and other such heroes should
pick the Expert class if they wish to focus on developing their special skills and performing tremendous feats of mastery with them.
Experts gain the widest variety of non-combat skills and are the
quickest to learn more of them.

An Expert has an uncanny knack for wielding their skills successfully at a crucial moment, whether or not it’s a skill they’ve taken
for their specialty. Once per scene, the Expert can reroll a failed
non-combat skill check, gaining a second chance to yank victory
from the jaws of otherwise certain failure. Their natural focus on personal development and determined refinement of their skills bleeds
through even into those talents they don’t make their special domain.

Experts are also capable combatants, fully able to hold their
own in the midst of a murderous fray. It’s not unknown for some
Experts to specialize in professions related to martial pursuits, such
as an assassin who relies heavily on their superb powers of stealth
and deception to reach their unwary foes.

### Class Ability: Masterful Expertise

Once per scene, a Full Expert may reroll any non-combat skill
check as an Instant action. This allows the Expert to make a roll
and then immediately use this ability if the resulting total isn’t good
enough to succeed. In cases where it matters, the better of the two
rolls may be used.

Note that the typical ten-minute dungeon exploration turn generally counts as a scene, allowing the Full Expert to use this ability
every turn if they so wish.

Partial Experts do not receive this ability.

### Class Ability: Quick Learner

When you advance a character level, you gain an extra skill point
which may only be spent on gaining or improving non-combat
skills or raising attributes. You may save this point to spend later
if you wish.

Partial Experts do receive this ability.

## The Bard

Bards are those who have an uncanny ability to move others
through the power of their performance.

### Benefits of the Bard

The Bard is a partial Expert class that must be joined with a second
partial class by an Adventurer. A Partial Warrior/Bard might be
a martial skald, a Partial Expert/Bard might be a light-fingered
troubadour, while a Partial Mage/Bard might mix true magic in
with their artful performances.

All Bards gain Perform-0 during character creation. Their abilities
hinge on their power to move a listener, whether that is by song,
musicianship, or stirring oratory.

Unlike the normal Partial Expert class, Bards do not get a bonus
non-combat Focus at first level, nor do they get a Partial Expert’s
bonus skill point when advancing a character level. One who
takes the standard Partial Expert for their other class gains these
things normally.

### Bard Arts

A Bard has an Effort score equal to their Perform skill level plus their
Charisma modifier, to a minimum of one point. Bard arts may be
used in or out of armor, and do not count as magical effects for the
purposes of abilities that counter or detect magic. Unless specified
otherwise, their range is out to normal unaided voice range.

Every Bard gains A Thousand Tongues as a starting art, plus
one more of their choice. As they advance in levels, they can pick
additional arts.

**A Thousand Tongues:** Your arts that require communication are
intuitively understood by all intelligent creatures, whether or not
you speak their language. You can learn a new language with no
more than a week of study with a native speaker.

#### Bard Arts

| Level | Arts Gained                    |
| :---: | :----------------------------- |
|   1   | A Thousand Tongues and Any One |
|   2   | Any One                        |
|   3   |                                |
|   4   | Any One                        |
|   5   |                                |

|  10   | Any One                        |

**Battle Cry:** Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action to
bolster your allies. They gain +1 to hit, saving throws, and damage,
including Shock, for one round per level. At 4th level this bonus
increases to +2, and at 9th, to +3.

**Cursed Tune:** Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action while
targeting an intelligent creature. Your imprecations cause them to
falter, inflicting a -1 penalty to their hit, damage, and saving throw
rolls for one round per level. At 4th level this penalty becomes -2,
and at 9th it becomes -3.

**Deft Fingers:** You’re accustomed to juggling your belongings
while holding an instrument. Your maximum Readied item count
increases by two.

**Entangle Incantation:** Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant
action when an foe within 60’ incants a spell. Your voice tangles
with their words, forcing them to make an opposed Int/Magic vs
Cha/Perform skill check against you, with a +2 bonus to your roll. 
If you tie or succeed, the spell fizzles and is wasted. This art can
be used only once per round.

**Evoke Emotion:** Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action while
performing. You evoke a desired emotion in listeners, whether intelligent
or animal, granting a +1 bonus to relevant social skill checks
for the scene for you and your allies. If desired, you can force a new
Reaction Roll, taking it if it’s more favorable than the original. This
art does not work in combat and can be used only once per scene.

**Inspire Dread:** Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action
when your enemies are forced to make a Morale check. You goad their fears, forcing them to make two Morale checks instead of
one. Those who succeed on both must still make an Instinct check
immediately after.

**Keen Senses:** This art gives you the equivalent of sight out to 60’
even if blinded. You cannot distinguish colors, but you can perceive
physical details as readily as if with your eyes. Physically-invisible
creatures and objects are obvious to you.

**Liberating Song:** You are immune to mind- or emotion-controlling
effects. You can Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action
to grant any ally in range a Mental saving throw to throw off such
effects, assuming they allowed a save to begin with. If the second
save is failed, this art cannot help them.

**Rally:** Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action to exhort a
wounded or fallen ally, removing any Frailty. The target regains
2d6 plus your level in hit points, but you incur one System Strain.

**Soothe the Savage:** Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action.
For as long as you keep spending a Main Action performing each
round, animals and other living bestial creatures will not attack you
or your allies unless commanded by their masters or threatened by
the party. This art can’t be triggered once actual combat has begun.

**Soothing Graces:** Your arts restore and hearten those with you. You
and your allies lose an extra point of System Strain after each night’s
comfortable rest. This does not stack with similar rest-aiding powers.

**Swift Misdirection:** Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action
and target one intelligent creature within earshot. Tell them
something in no more than one sentence; unless what you say is
physically impossible or emotionally unendurable, they must make
a Mental save or believe it for one round. After that, they can judge
your words with their normal reason. This art can affect a creature
only once per scene.

## The Wise

Some low-magic settings have a particular place for concepts that
aren’t exactly magical, but have some special place in society.
Whether a mundane priest of the dominant faith, a feared forest
warlock, or a sacred oracle of the gods, these Wise have a special
role to fill.

Some of these Wise may have very minor or subtle magical
powers suitable to a low-magic campaign setting.

In general, the Wise class is usually only viable in a low- or
no-magic setting where their limited powers are still more than
almost anyone else has access to. If standard magic exists in your
campaign the Wise may not offer enough to appeal to players.

### Benefits of the Wise

The Wise is a partial Expert class that must be taken by an Adventurer with another partial class. It’s generally suited for low-magic
campaigns, but strictly mundane versions of it may pass muster for
a no-magic setting.

While the Wise count as a partial Expert class for other purposes, they do not gain the advantage of the partial Expert’s **Quick Learner** class ability or the bonus non-combat Focus that a partial
Expert normally gets at first level. An Adventurer who is a standard
partial Expert/partial Wise does get these perks, however.

All Wise gain level-0 in a bonus skill appropriate to their concept,
be it Pray, Know, Magic, Survive, or some other skill that makes
sense to the GM.

The Wise do not use Effort. All of their arts are either constantly in
effect or can be used under particular circumstances or a particular
number of times each day.

The arts the Wise learn are generally fixed by their concept and
role. A mundane priest will learn certain arts as they advance in
level, while a witch or an oracular seer will learn others. At some
levels, the Wise might have a choice; they can pick whichever art
they wish, but most arts can be taken only once.

The example tables here provide progression patterns for a
non-magical priest of a faith, a witch with minor magical powers
of cursing and foresight, and an oracle with limited powers of
divination. For GMs that wish to allow player-made concepts, the
Esoteric column can be used, or a specific progression can be
worked up in cooperation with the player.

### General Arts

**Dread Awe:** Your kind are figures of fear and mistrust. Gain a +1
bonus on all skill checks related to intimidation or threat. You can
spend a Main Action cursing your foes in battle; those who hear
suffer a -1 penalty to their next Morale check. You can do this only
once per scene.

**Elite Ties:** You have ties with figures of societal importance. You
can get audiences with them with minimal effort. Once per game
session, get a favor from them that would not particularly inconvenience them to grant.

**Erudite:** You are uncommonly learned. Once per day, reroll a
failed skill check related to intellectual pursuits or things a scholar
would know about.

**Folk-Friend:** Commoners and other lower-class natives consider
you a useful healer and helper. Once per day, get a modest favor
from a commoner who doesn’t hate you in exchange for a blessing or bit of advice.

**Healer:** You are a trained and capable healer. Gain a +1 on all
Heal skill checks; once per day, as an On Turn action, automatically
succeed at a skill check to stabilize a Mortally Wounded subject.

**Holy Sanctity:** You are honored and respected by most in this region. Gain a +1 bonus on social skill checks with locals who are not
naturally opposed to your religion or social institution.

**Personal Impunity:** You bear signs of sanctity, and physically harming you is considered taboo in this region. Only the most vicious or
desperate humans will initiate violence against you, though any will
fight if you attack them. Hostile groups will hesitate to attack your
companions unless provoked.

**Skilled:** Gain three skill points to spend on any non-combat skills,
up to the maximum skill level allowed by your character level. This
art may be taken more than once.

### Divination Arts

**Compel Truth:** The diviner compels a person to drink a particular
brew, participate in a specific ritual, or otherwise undergo a scenelong ordeal. Afterwards, the diviner may ask the target a single question and the GM secretly rolls a Cha/Magic skill check against a
difficulty of the target’s Morale+1, or level+6 for PCs. On a success,
the subject must answer the question truthfully and fully. On a failure,
they may give any answer they wish. The same or substantially same
question may not be asked twice with this art.

**Deliver Oracle:** A petitioner asks about the outcome of a particular
course of action. The diviner then spends a day in various rituals,
seeking an oracular answer. At the end, the GM makes a secret Wis/
Magic skill check. If the skill check beats difficulty 8, an oracular sentence with some truth in it is produced. If the skill check beats difficulty
12, a direct and obvious oracle is produced. If the skill check is 7 or
less, a hopelessly ambiguous oracle is produced, and if the dice roll
a natural 2 an intentionally misleading oracle is delivered. Oracles
are usually delivered as metaphors, poetry, or visions. The GM should
ensure that some element of a true oracle actually does come to pass.

**Find Object:** The diviner spends a scene performing a ritual to locate
a particular animal, object or type of substance known to them, be it
gold, water, or a specific stolen cow. People cannot be found with this
art. The GM makes a secret Wis/Magic skill check against a difficulty
of 8 to 11, depending on how close the nearest suitable object is;
something in the same village is 8, something a mile or more away is 11, and something more than five miles away is undetectable. If the
check is successful, the diviner gets an impression of the direction the
object is in. On a failure, roll 1d12 and use it as a clock face to give
a random direction. This art can be used once per day.

**Read Omens:** A petitioner proposes a course of action to the PC.
After a scene-long ritual involving at least 10 sp worth of livestock or
sacrificial material, the GM makes a secret Wis/Magic skill check
against difficulty 10. On a success, the PC gets an impression of
whether the course of action will lead to success or failure, as the
GM thinks most likely. On a failure, the GM gives a random result.
Multiplying the ritual costs by 10 adds +1 to the skill check, thus, a
sacrifice of 1,000 sp worth of livestock gets a +2 on the check. The
same course of action cannot be divined more than once a month.

### Curses and Blessings

The bringing of fortune or ill fate is not a trivial thing. A given creature
can be cursed or blessed by one of these arts only once a day.

**Auspicious Undertaking:** As a Main Action, bless a particular
plan or undertaking currently sought by the target. During the plan’s
execution or while seeking the desired end, the blessed subject can
reroll one failed skill check or one missed hit roll. The blessing lasts
until it is used, the plan is finished, or one day per caster level has
passed. Only one plan can be blessed at a time.

**Evil Eye:** This art improves your curse and blessing arts. You can now
use these arts as an Instant action, albeit still only one such art per
round, and you need do no more than look at the target rather than
vocalizing any particular curse or blessing.

**Ill Fate:** As a Main Action, curse a visible target. You may specify
a particular kind of undertaking or apply the curse to anything they
may do. The next pertinent skill check they make is made at a -1
penalty. If their raw die roll is equal or less than the PC’s Magic skill
plus one their effort goes disastrously wrong. The curse lasts until the
next relevant skill check.

**Luck Blessing:** As a Main Action, confer a blessing on a visible target.
The next skill check they make that day will have a +1 bonus. Only
one luck blessing can be in place for a creature at a time.

**War Curse:** As a Main Action, curse a visible enemy. They suffer a
-2 penalty to hit rolls, damage rolls, and Shock damage for the rest
of the scene. If they miss an attack with a raw to-hit die roll less than
the Wise’s Magic skill, they accidentally hurt themselves for normal
damage. Only one war curse can be applied at a time.
