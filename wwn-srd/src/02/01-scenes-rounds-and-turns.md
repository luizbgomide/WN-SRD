# Scenes, Rounds, and Tuns

During play, three special measures of time are used: scenes, rounds,
and turns.

## Scenes

A scene is a time measurement used to determine how often certain
abilities or actions can be taken. Some powers can be triggered
only so many times per scene, while some special abilities only work
once per scene.

A scene is one particular fight, event, activity, or effort that usually
doesn’t take more than ten or fifteen minutes. A fight is a scene. A
chase is a scene. A tense backroom negotiation is a scene. So long
as the PCs are doing the same general activity in the same general
location, it’s probably one scene. Most scenes don’t last more than
fifteen minutes, though a GM can stretch this if it seems logical.

## Rounds

Combat is made up of rounds, each one lasting approximately six
seconds. A single combat may involve multiple rounds of action. A
round begins with the actions of the side that wins initiative and ends
after the actions of the side that lost initiative.

## Turns

Sometimes it’s important to track the time of a more complex operation, like exploring a dungeon or navigating the trackless depths of
some ancient ruin. In such cases, the turn is a common measure of
time. Each turn lasts ten minutes and is equivalent to one scene for
those situations when it matters.
