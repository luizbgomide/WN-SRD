# Monsters and Foes

The following page includes a list of example stat lines for various
kinds of people and creatures. These are not universal truths for every
being in the campaign setting, but they’re good baselines for what
to expect from a given creature. As a first step in building a creature
a GM should pick the stat line that fits best the type of foe they need,
and then modify it to suit their own purposes.

Note that there’s nothing stopping you from putting a guaranteed
party-slaughterer in your campaign. If the situation logically requires
that such a creature be present, then it ought to be there. If logic requires its existence, however, you should take pains to ensure that the
PCs are not forced to actually fight the thing. They need to be able to
get forewarnings of its presence, or opportunities to flee it, or some
means to negotiate with it or hide from it. It’s not unfair to populate
your world with the creatures that ought to live in it, but it’s decidedly
unfun to shove hapless PCs face-first into certain death.
