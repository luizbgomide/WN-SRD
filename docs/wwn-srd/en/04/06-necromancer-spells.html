                        <h1 id="necromancer-spells"><a class="header" href="#necromancer-spells">Necromancer Spells</a></h1>
<p>Only Full and Partial Necromancers have the necessary background
to learn or cast these spells.</p>
<h3 id="command-the-dead--level-1"><a class="header" href="#command-the-dead--level-1">Command the Dead — Level 1</a></h3>
<p>The necromancer exerts their will over a number of hit dice worth
of undead equal to twice their character level. These undead must
be visible and within one hundred feet of the caster. Undead get a
Mental saving throw to resist this binding, at a penalty equal to the
caster’s Magic skill. Creatures only partially-bewitched by the spell
due to their excess hit dice merely stand dazed for a round. Those
fully within the hit die cap who are affected become suicidally loyal
to the necromancer until they are released by the caster. Regardless
of how often the caster uses this spell, they may have no more than
twice their level worth of hit dice bound at any one time, with the
oldest-enchanted being first released.</p>
<h3 id="query-the-skull--level-1"><a class="header" href="#query-the-skull--level-1">Query the Skull — Level 1</a></h3>
<p>This spell requires a corpse with largely-intact organs of communication. The corpse cannot have been dead for more than one day
per caster level. Once sorceled, the corpse will answer up to one
question per caster level, with the caster understanding the answers
regardless of the creature’s natural language. Corpses are laconic,
and generally answer in no more than one or two sentences; their
replies will be truthful, but tend to be literal and they have no power
to hypothesize or make judgments. This spell may not be used twice
on the same corpse.</p>
<h3 id="smite-the-dead--level-1"><a class="header" href="#smite-the-dead--level-1">Smite the Dead — Level 1</a></h3>
<p>The necromancer conjures a blast of dispelling force at a point within
one hundred feet per caster level, affecting an area up to 20 feet in
radius. All hostile undead within that area immediately suffer 1d10
damage per caster level. Undead with hit dice equal or less than the
caster’s level must make a Physical save or be destroyed outright.
The necromancer may Commit Effort for the day immediately before
casting this spell; if so, its casting does not count against the Necromancer’s available spell slots for the day.</p>
<h3 id="terrible-liveliness--level-1"><a class="header" href="#terrible-liveliness--level-1">Terrible Liveliness — Level 1</a></h3>
<p>A necromancer can give an undead creature the semblance of a
healthy, normal living being with this spell. The target appears as it
did in life, at any point in its lifespan that the necromancer so desires,
and is capable of performing all normal human activities that its cognition allows it to perform. The spell uses the creature’s nature as a
template for its effects, so the disguise is tangible and physically real
until dispelled or the necromancer drops the effect. A necromancer
can maintain only one such disguise per level, and it does not work
on sentient unwilling targets.</p>
<h3 id="augment-mortal-vitality--level-2"><a class="header" href="#augment-mortal-vitality--level-2">Augment Mortal Vitality — Level 2</a></h3>
<p>The necromancer may refine and enhance the natural flow of vitality
within a willing visible target. For the rest of the scene, all Physical
saving throws they make gain a bonus equal to the necromancer’s
Magic skill and they automatically stabilize when Mortally Wounded.
Once during the scene, as an Instant action, they can immediately
heal from all damage inflicted by an injury that did not Mortally
Wound them. The recipient of this spell gains one System Strain.</p>
<h3 id="enfeebling-wave--level-2"><a class="header" href="#enfeebling-wave--level-2">Enfeebling Wave — Level 2</a></h3>
<p>A wash of debilitating force erupts in a 20-foot radius at a visible
point within one hundred feet. All living creatures within the area
must make a Physical saving throw or for the rest of the scene their
movement rate is halved and they must make all attack and damage
rolls twice and take the worse result. If the save is successful, these
penalties apply only to their next turn.</p>
<h3 id="final-death--level-2"><a class="header" href="#final-death--level-2">Final Death — Level 2</a></h3>
<p>The necromancer curses one visible target per level. For the rest of
the scene, these targets cannot recover or gain hit points and will die
instantly if Mortally Wounded. After each failed instance of healing,
a target can make a Physical save to throw off the spell.</p>
<h3 id="raise-corpse--level-2"><a class="header" href="#raise-corpse--level-2">Raise Corpse — Level 2</a></h3>
<p>The necromancer targets a mostly-intact skeleton or corpse, imbuing
it with a semblance of life. Whatever the creature’s attributes were in
life, it now has 1 HD, an AC of 13, a Move of 30’/round, a +0 skill
bonus, saves of 15+, a +1/1d6 unarmed melee attack, Instinct 0,
and a Morale of 12. Such corpses may be equipped with weapons
or armor. Its decay or dissolution immediately ceases, and it becomes
suicidally loyal to its creator. The corpse has no natural volition, but
will obey commands with a human degree of intelligence. It has
only vague memories of its prior life, and while it may retain human
tics or habits it had in life it can answer only the simplest and most
self-evident questions. Damage to a corpse can be repaired only by
casting this spell on it again, which restores it to its original “health”.
The corpse continues to exist until it is reduced to zero hit points or its
creator releases it. A necromancer cannot have more active subjects
of this spell than their character level.</p>
<h3 id="compel-flesh--level-3"><a class="header" href="#compel-flesh--level-3">Compel Flesh — Level 3</a></h3>
<p>A visible living creature or physically-bodied undead within 100 feet
is ensorceled by this spell, their flesh and bones becoming temporarily enthralled to the caster’s will. The target becomes paralyzed
unless commanded by the caster as an On Turn action; once given a
command, their body will dutifully carry it out on their next turn. The
user’s mind is not affected by this spell, so they cannot be made to
cast spells, answer questions, or perform other intellectual tasks, but
they will fight, move, and perform other non-suicidal physical acts
as normal. The target may make a Physical saving throw at the start
of each of their turns to throw off the effect, but they will inevitably
suffer one point of damage per caster level with each attempt as
their flesh writhes and tears. If not thrown off earlier, the spell lasts
until the end of the scene.</p>
<h3 id="festering-curse--level-3"><a class="header" href="#festering-curse--level-3">Festering Curse — Level 3</a></h3>
<p>The qualities of a corpse are forced upon a visible living target. The
subject begins to rot, fester, and decay in whatever ways the necromancer thinks appropriate. Food tastes like ashes, water does not
quench thirst, and their body is numb to all physical pleasures. They
suffer a -2 penalty to all social skill checks due to their repugnance.
This transformation does not inflict physical injury, but it makes the target’s life an utterly joyless misery until it is dispelled or the necromancer lifts the curse. Creatures with more hit dice than the necromancer
has levels can make a Physical save to resist the curse.</p>
<h3 id="forgetting-the-grave--level-3"><a class="header" href="#forgetting-the-grave--level-3">Forgetting the Grave — Level 3</a></h3>
<p>A necromancer can temporarily suspend the mortality of a willing
target within sight. For one round per Necromancer level, the creature
simply cannot die, no matter how drastic their injuries. Those reduced
to zero hit points lose their Move action each turn but can continue
to act otherwise; if such a target is damaged yet again, they must
make a Physical saving throw each time or become incapable of
movement until healed. At the spell’s end targets reduced to zero hit
points are Mortally Wounded; those that have been dismembered
or otherwise slaughtered beyond the hope of survival die instantly.</p>
<h3 id="merge-souls--level-3"><a class="header" href="#merge-souls--level-3">Merge Souls — Level 3</a></h3>
<p>By molding the plasmic stuff of life force, the necromancer can create
a bond between two willing or helpless targets. These subjects must
be close enough for the necromancer to touch; thereafter, for as
long as the spell is in effect, the two creatures pool their hit points.
Injuries to either subtract from this pool, and neither dies until it is
reduced to zero, whereupon both are Mortally Wounded. They can
communicate telepathically at will while the spell is in effect. The
power ends at daybreak; if dispelled sooner, the remaining pool is
split proportionately.</p>
<h3 id="boneshaper--level-4"><a class="header" href="#boneshaper--level-4">Boneshaper — Level 4</a></h3>
<p>The clay of flesh and bone run obediently to the will of the necromancer. Whether living or undead, a willing or helpless victim under the
effects of this spell can be reshaped into any roughly-equivalent form
with an hour’s work. Limbs can be added or removed and existing
tissue can be recolored, re-textured, or rearranged to the necromancer’s wishes. Perfect imitation of a particular creature requires
a Dex/Magic skill check against difficulty 10. This spell is limited in
the physical changes it can effect; a bonus of +1 can be added to
modifier of Charisma or a physical attribute at the cost of a -1 penalty
to the modifier of one of the same attributes, to a maximum of +2 or
-2. This spell lasts until the necromancer lifts it or it is dispelled.</p>
<h3 id="raise-grave-knight--level-4"><a class="header" href="#raise-grave-knight--level-4">Raise Grave Knight — Level 4</a></h3>
<p>The corpse used for this spell must be of a relatively powerful creature
with at least four hit dice or levels. The result is much like that of the
<strong>Raise Corpse</strong> spell, but this undead servitor is much stronger, with
4 HD, AC 15, a Move of 40’/action, a +1 skill bonus, saves of 13+,
Instinct 0, Morale of 12, and a melee attack of +6/1d10, assuming
it doesn’t use a normal weapon. It is fully intelligent and self-willed,
albeit utterly devoted to its creator, and it remembers a significant
amount about its prior life. A grave knight regains all lost hit points
at dusk each day, assuming it’s not destroyed. A caster may have
only one grave knight active at a time. One that has been reduced
to zero hit points is destroyed and can only be rebuilt with a month
of painstaking repair and re-enchantment.</p>
<h3 id="call-of-the-tomb--level-5"><a class="header" href="#call-of-the-tomb--level-5">Call of the Tomb — Level 5</a></h3>
<p>The necromancer invokes the inescapable urge for self-dissolution
within the substance of all that exists, amplifying the weight of their
own mortality. All enemy creatures within forty feet are affected.
Targets can make a Physical saving throw to resist, in which case the
effects last only one round, otherwise lasting for one round per caster
level. During this time all attacks made against the victims automatically hit and all damage dice they suffer are maximized. Any special
defenses they may have against mundane weapons or certain types
of injury are negated while the spell is on them.</p>
<h3 id="everlasting--level-5"><a class="header" href="#everlasting--level-5">Everlasting — Level 5</a></h3>
<p>The spell may be triggered as an Instant action by the caster, imparting
a burst of unquenchable life force to all allied creatures within 50
feet. For the next five rounds, no affected ally can be reduced below
1 hit point, regardless of the damage inflicted upon them. At the end
of the spell’s effect, the caster’s own life energy is exhausted, leaving
them with only 1 hit point. A creature can benefit from this spell no
more than once per day.</p>
