                        <h1 id="crafting-and-modifying-gear"><a class="header" href="#crafting-and-modifying-gear">Crafting and Modifying Gear</a></h1>
<p>Any Expert or Partial Expert PC with at least Craft-1 skill, or any PC
with the Artisan Focus, can modify equipment with ancient salvage.
Their crafting background does not need to precisely match the gear
they’re modifying; the basic principles of using ancient salvage are
the same among all disciplines.</p>
<h2 id="crafting-gear"><a class="header" href="#crafting-gear">Crafting Gear</a></h2>
<p>An artisan requires a workshop that could plausibly build the gear in
question. This may be nothing more than a sharp knife for a simple
device, or a full-fledged alchemy lab for others. They also require
a plausible source of parts for the device. This is usually a given if
in a city or other salvage-rich area, but it may not be practical in a
wilderness.</p>
<p>Building gear takes a month for a wagon-sized vehicle or a week
for a weapon, suit of armor, or other portable complex device. Very
simple devices may be built faster at the GM’s discretion.</p>
<p>Crafted gear is made at three levels of quality. Jury-rigged gear
takes one-half the time to build and costs one-quarter the market
cost in parts. If scrap salvage is available it can be built at no cost
but normal build times. As an improvised device, it counts as a mod
requiring Craft-0 to keep functional, as explained below in the mod
maintenance rules. If it goes 24 hours without maintenance, it stops
functioning. Jury-rigged devices cannot be further modded.</p>
<p>Normal devices cost the same amount in parts as the market cost
and take the normal amount of time to build. They cannot be built with
salvaged parts unless the GM decides the salvage is perfectly suited
for it. Consumable devices such as torches must be crafted as normal
devices rather than jury-rigged or mastercrafted ones.</p>
<p>Mastercrafted devices cost ten times as much in parts as the usual
market cost and take twice as long to build. They are ideal platforms
for an artisan’s mods, however, and the first mod their creator installs
in them requires no maintenance. Mastercrafted weapons grant a +1
to hit. Mastercrafted armor counts as 1 fewer point of encumbrance,
down to a minimum of 1 point. This lightening does not affect the
armor’s suitability for a user of the <strong>Armored Magic</strong> Focus.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-gear"><a class="header" href="#modifying-gear">Modifying Gear</a></h2>
<p>Crafted or purchased gear can be modified by a skilled artisan.
Crafting mods also requires a minimum Fix skill. Without this skill level
the tech cannot install the mod or maintain it afterwards.</p>
<p>Crafting and installing mods has a cost in silver and sometimes
in arcane salvage. The latter consists of rare monster parts, esoteric
materials, and exotic components that cannot normally be bought on
the open market, but must be acquired by adventuring or in payment
from patrons. Arcane salvage is generic in nature; a given piece can
be used in any mod that requires salvage.</p>
<p>It takes one week per minimum skill level of the mod to build and
install it. Thus, if the mod requires Craft-1 skill, it takes one week. If the
artisan has an assistant with at least Craft-0 skill, this time is halved. If
they do nothing but eat, sleep, and work, this time is further halved.</p>
<h2 id="maintaining-mods"><a class="header" href="#maintaining-mods">Maintaining Mods</a></h2>
<p>Mods normally require maintenance to keep functioning correctly,
and a given artisan can maintain only so many mods at once. An artisan can only maintain mods they have the requisite skill levels to build.</p>
<p>An artisan’s maximum maintenance score is equal to the total of
their Intelligence and Constitution modifiers plus three times their Craft
skill level. Thus, a tech with a +1 Intelligence mod, a -1 Constitution
mod and Craft-1 could maintain up to three mods at any one time.</p>
<p>Maintenance is assumed to take place during downtime and does
not require any significantly expensive components. If an artisan does
nothing but maintain mods, they can double their allowed number.
Such work assumes sixteen-hour workdays.</p>
<p>If a mod goes without maintenance for 24 hours, it stops working. If
it goes without maintenance for a week, the item it’s attached to stops
working, becoming dangerous or ineffective to use. A maintenance
backlog on an item can be cleared by an hour’s work by an artisan
capable of maintaining it.</p>
<h2 id="example-modifications"><a class="header" href="#example-modifications">Example Modifications</a></h2>
<p>The mods listed here are merely some of the possibilities for using
ancient salvage or large amounts of costly mundane materials. These
mods are almost never available on the open market due to the rarity
of usable salvage and the difficulty of maintaining the gear. Acquiring
the salvage needed to make them usually means finding it as part
of an adventure, receiving it in payment from a patron, or setting out
on specific expeditions to find it.</p>
<p>Multiple modifications can stack, but cannot increase a hit, AC, or
damage bonus above +3, or a skill check bonus above +1. Magical
and masterwork weapons and armor can be modified, but mods
can’t improve them above this cap.</p>
<p><strong>Arrow Storm (Craft-2):</strong> A bow or other projectile weapon automatically generates its own ammunition, albeit the conjured projectiles
vanish a round after firing. This mod does not increase reload speed.
Cost: One unit of salvage and 5,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Assassin’s Trinket (Craft-2):</strong> A one-handed weapon is modified
to adopt the shape of some item of jewelry or adornment. It can be
shifted to or from this shape by the owner as an On Turn action. Cost:
One unit of salvage and 1,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Augmented Gear (Craft-1):</strong> A tool, medical kit, or other item of
equipment is improved for a specific purpose chosen at the time of
augmentation. Skill checks made for that purpose gain a +1 skill bonus with the item. Cost: One unit of salvage and 5,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Reload (Craft-2):</strong> A hurlant can be modified to reload
itself, if ammunition is available. Once per scene, a man-portable
hurlant can be reloaded as an On Turn action. Cost: Two units of
salvage and 10,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Customized (Craft-1):</strong> The weapon or suit of armor has been carefully tailored for a specific user. When used by them, they gain a +1
to hit with the weapon or +1 Armor Class with the armor. This mod
doesn’t work with shields. Cost: 1,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Flying Razor (Craft-1):</strong> A throwing weapon is imbued with various
esoteric materials, allowing it to return to the hand of its thrower after
each attack. Cost: One unit of salvage and 5,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Harmonized Aegis (Craft-3):</strong> A suit of armor is altered to harmonize
with the dangerous sorceries of allied casters. Provided the wearer
and the caster have had ten minutes to coordinate the protection, the
wearer is unharmed by the caster’s harmful spells for the rest of the
day, even if caught in their area of effect. Cost: One unit of salvage
and 10,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Long Arm (Craft-2):</strong> A ranged or thrown weapon is modified to
double its normal and maximum ranges. Cost: One unit of salvage
and 5,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Manifold Mail (Craft-2):</strong> A suit of armor is augmented to allow it
to shift its appearance to any of five or six pre-set choices, mimicking normal clothing or other armor types as an On Turn action. The
armor’s Encumbrance or other statistics are not altered. Cost: One
unit of salvage, 5,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Omened Aim (Craft-2):</strong> Occult components improve a ranged
or thrown weapon’s targeting, adding +1 to hit rolls. Cost: 4,000
silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Preserving Grace (Craft-1):</strong> A suit of clothing or armor is specially
altered to preserve the wearer. Once per week, when the wearer is
Mortally Wounded, they will automatically stabilize. Cost: One unit
of salvage and 5,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Razor Edge (Craft-2):</strong> A weapon has been given an improved
edge or shifting weight system, adding +2 to the damage and Shock
it does, albeit requiring far more care. Cost: One unit of salvage and
5,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Tailored Harness (Craft-2):</strong> A suit of armor is altered to perfectly fit
a single wearer, decreasing its effective Encumbrance by 1 for them
only. This does not affect skill check penalties or the Armored Magic
Focus. Cost: 5,000 silver pieces.</p>
<p><strong>Thirsting Blade (Craft-3):</strong> A weapon is imbued with a fated inclination to harm, adding +1 to hit rolls. Cost: Two units of salvage and
10,000 silver pieces.</p>
