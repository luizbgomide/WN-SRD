<p>The Skinshifter is a partial Mage class that grants the user shapeshifting abilities, whether to adopt the form of beasts or configurations
of their own devising.</p>
<h2 id="skinshifter-benefits"><a class="header" href="#skinshifter-benefits">Skinshifter Benefits</a></h2>
<p>Skinshifter is a partial Mage class, meant to be taken by an Adventurer in conjunction with another partial class. A Partial Warrior/
Skinshifter might be a shapeshifting assassin or feral savage warrior, while a Partial Expert/Skinshifter could be an undetectable
impostor or con artist.</p>
<p>All Skinshifters gain Survive-0 as a bonus skill, or Survive-1 if
they already have Survive-0 as a skill.</p>
<h2 id="skinshifter-forms"><a class="header" href="#skinshifter-forms">Skinshifter Forms</a></h2>
<p>The arts of a Skinshifter revolve around improving or adjusting their
alternate forms. These alternate forms have a few basic rules that
apply to all their permutations.</p>
<p>A Skinshifter can master one alternate form per character level.
A Skinshifter who wants to change a form selection can do so with
a day of careful practice and adjustment. Skinshifter PCs should
note down the special powers or traits of their alternate forms and
keep in mind which of them they have available at any one time.</p>
<p>A Skinshifter’s alternate forms use the same hit points, character
attributes, and movement speed as their normal form, unless modified by particular arts. Thus, a Skinshifter shifted into a wolf’s shape
would do no more damage with its bite than the human’s unarmed
attack would do without some augmenting art. Alternate forms do
grant a minimum level of combat competence, however, and so
the “Form Bonus” hit bonus is used in place of the PC’s basic class
hit bonus when in a non-humanoid shape, assuming they don’t
already have a better basic bonus from their other partial class.</p>
<p>Arts that improve the alternate forms can apply their benefits
even if the creature’s natural shape wouldn’t normally grant it. Thus,
a Skinshifter with the Manifest Wings art could have a wolf-form
that had wings and a flying speed if they wished. A given form can
have no more than three arts applied to it.</p>
<p>A Skinshifter’s alternate forms can be any size between a horse
and a kitten, barring modification by some art. They do not need
to emulate a specific type of creature; a Skinshifter could have a
clawed and winged humanoid form as an alternate shape, or a
dog with the head of a man, or a cat with razor-sharp mandibles.</p>
<p>The belongings carried by a Skinshifter meld into any new form
unless the PC decides otherwise, granting any benefit to Armor
Class or other worn advantage they may normally give. Melded
objects can be manifested and dropped as an On Turn action,
but cannot be re-melded again unless the PC changes form with
them again.</p>
<p>Skinshifter forms cannot perfectly duplicate another individual creature without an appropriate art.</p>
<h2 id="skinshifter-arts"><a class="header" href="#skinshifter-arts">Skinshifter Arts</a></h2>
<p>Skinshifter Effort is based on Survive, and is equal to the PC’s Survive skill level plus the highest of their Constitution or Charisma
modifiers, to a minimum of one point. All Skinshifters begin play
with the <strong>Change Form</strong> art and one more of their choice. Additional
arts are learned as the PC advances in experience.</p>
<p><strong>Change Form:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action to transform into an available Alternate form. This shift persists until you die,
shift to a new form, or end the transformation as an On Turn action.
Your hit points, System Strain, and other scores remain the same in
any new form, but in a non-humanoid form your class’ base attack
bonus can be no worse than the one listed on the table. If your shape
is quadrupedal, its Move is 10’ faster than your base.</p>

<p><strong>Eyes of the Hawk:</strong> This shape has remarkably acute senses. You can
scent trails and objects like a dog, hear very faint noises, see objects
clearly enough to identify faces at a thousand feet of distance, and
see clearly in anything short of complete darkness. You gain a +2
bonus on all sensory Notice checks.</p>
<p><strong>Feline Leap:</strong> This form can vault great distances. You can jump your
full Move rating as a Move action, crossing the full distance horizontally or up to half the distance vertically. You subtract your Move
rating from fall distance for damage calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Feral Prowess:</strong> This form has an augmented degree of speed,
strength, or hardiness. For this form, pick either Strength, Dexterity,
or Constitution; that attribute modifier is improved by +1 in this form,
to a maximum of +2. These alterations are obvious and extreme; it is
impossible to masquerade as a normal baseline human if using this art.
Hit points gained from Con improvements are lost when shifting back.</p>
<p><strong>Intrinsic Armor:</strong> This shape has tough scales, hide, shell, or other
defensive integuments. Your base Armor Class is 14 plus half your
character level, rounded down. This AC can be modified by your
Dexterity modifier, and by shields if the shape can hold one.</p>
<p><strong>Manifest Wings:</strong> This shape can form usable wings. You can’t effectively attack while concentrating on remaining aloft, but you can
fly at your normal movement rate +10’ per action. If unhindered and
flying overland you can travel up to ten miles an hour and fly up to
five hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>Octopus’ Embrace:</strong> This shape can have more than four usable
limbs. These additional tentacles, arms, legs, or grippers can hold and
manipulate things; up to four Stowed objects can be held Ready by
these limbs without counting against your Readied Encumbrance limit.
These extra limbs cannot effectively employ extra shields, perform
additional attacks or actions, or do other things that require significant
focus beyond your current action.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Mimicry:</strong> This alternate form can exactly duplicate another
creature, provided you either have a lock of their hair, a still-liquid
drop of their blood, or ten minutes of observation of them from within
five feet. Once learned, you need no further samples.</p>
<p><strong>Pliant Flesh:</strong> You’ve mastered your shapeshifting skills, and Change
Form can be used as an On Turn action, albeit only once per round.
Alternately, it can take as long as a minute but cost no Effort. Whenever you spend Effort to shift shape, you heal lost hit points equal
to 1d6 plus your level; this does not apply when merely reverting a
form’s change. This art is intrinsic to you, and doesn’t count against
the total number of arts allowed to apply to a form.</p>
<p><strong>Savage Talons:</strong> This shape has extremely dangerous claws, fangs,
pincers, or other body weapons. At first level these weapons do 1d8
damage, use either Str or Dex as the modifying attribute, Punch as
the combat skill, and have a Shock value of 2/AC 13. At level 3 the
damage and Shock increase by +1, at level 6 they increase to +2,
and at level 9 they increase to +3. These weapons can harm even
creatures immune to non-magical weaponry.</p>
<p><strong>Sculptor’s Beauty:</strong> You’ve developed a refined aesthetic sense
that can directly appeal to the subconscious beauty preferences of
viewers. This shape improves your Charisma modifier by +1, to a maximum of +2. There is always something alien about this beauty,
and such forms can never be mistaken for an entirely normal human
or animal, though they may be taken for some exotic demihuman
or altered baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Kiss:</strong> This shape can exude a venom on its claws or fangs.
Successful hits allow you to Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant
action to inflict an additional 1d8 damage plus your Survive skill. You
can elect to make the toxin paralytic rather than fatal; foes reduced
to zero hit points by such a blow are paralyzed and helpless for an
hour rather than mortally wounded.</p>
<p><strong>The Monkey’s Road:</strong> This shape has an arboreal agility when it
comes to climbing. You can travel up sheer surfaces at your usual
movement rate provided at least three limbs are available for use
and the surface is not glassily smooth. If you fall, you can halt your
plunge without damage so long as a serviceable surface to cling to
is within ten feet of you.</p>
<p><strong>Warform:</strong> You gain a flat +2 bonus to all melee hit rolls in this shape
and can use your form hit bonus even in a humanoid body. This shape
is blatantly martial in appearance, however, and cannot pass as
anything harmless or wholly human.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom of Fin and Scale:</strong> This shape can breathe water, swim
at double your usual Move rate, and is impervious to any normal
climatic extreme of cold or undersea pressure. It can see up to sixty
feet while underwater even in the absence of normal light.</p>
