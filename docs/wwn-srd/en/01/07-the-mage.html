<p>The Mage class is a general header under which all heroes with
fundamentally supernatural powers or spellcasting ability are place.
Once this class is chosen, the PC must choose a specific arcane
tradition to follow; one is a High Mage, or a Vowed, or an Elementalist, for example.</p>
<p>Not all magical traditions necessarily involve classical spell-flinging and conjury. Some traditions are much more physical in nature,
granting the practitioners remarkable bodily prowess or unique
magical gifts they can exercise. Some Mage traditions involve
no spellcasting at all, restricting their focus entirely to the strange
arcane gifts their forebears have developed.</p>
<p>While these spells and occult powers are impressive, they tend
to come at a cost. A Mage must spend so much time focused on
their studies and training that they have little time to master any
other art. Most are notably weak combatants with little ability to
survive hardships that would merely wound or weary a Warrior.</p>
<p>In addition to this, many traditions have their own specific limits
on practitioners. Initiates of the High Mage tradition, for example,
cannot cast their spells while wearing anything heavier than normal
clothing, thus making it impossible for them to wear armor and still
wield their spells. The hindrances of some traditions extend beyond
physical limitations to social penalties or difficulties in dealing with
mundane humanity; a necromancer may have impressive powers
of magic, but they are often unwelcome in civilized lands and are
sometimes subject to the panicked justice of frightened locals and
their lords.</p>
<p>The ways of magic tend to be specific to settings in a way that
swordplay or skillful arts are not. Your GM may disallow certain
Mage traditions or partial classes based on the particulars of their
own campaign world or the specific sort of game they want to
play. Some campaigns set in historical periods or very low-magic
worlds might not include Mages at all, leaving heroes reliant on the
strength of their own arms and the cunning of their own native wits.</p>
<p>Whatever the setting, Mage heroes need to rely on careful
planning and a cooperative party to get the most from their abilities.
While potent, the spells they wield are few in number and usually
narrow in effect; even the mightiest sorcerer is just not going to be
as effective as their Warrior peers in slaying fearsome enemies or
their Expert companions in carrying out the mundane activities of
stealth, persuasion, or investigation. Instead, Mages excel at providing carefully-planned impossibilities, those selective defiances
of reality that allow their teammates to pull off incredible schemes
or overcome otherwise insurmountable odds.</p>

<p>The Mage may pick one magical tradition to represent their occult
powers, as listed in this section. This tradition may give them a
number of additional benefits and restrictions.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-high-mage"><a class="header" href="#the-high-mage">The High Mage</a></h2>
<p>High Mages represent the default spellcaster in most campaigns.
Their spells tend to be generalist in nature rather than focusing on
particular specific themes, but their arts make them extremely skilled
at manipulating and augmenting the magics they use.</p>
<h3 id="high-mage-benefits"><a class="header" href="#high-mage-benefits">High Mage Benefits</a></h3>
<p>All High Mages gain Magic as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0,
or level-1 if was already level-0. Every High Mage is well-educated in the principles of magic as understood by the sorcerers of
this world.</p>
<p>High Mages can prepare and cast High Magic spells, and have
a number of arts dedicated to improving their use of these incantations. As usual for spellcasters, they cannot wear bulky clothing
or armor while casting or using arts, nor use shields. Mages who
have trained to overcome these limits with the <strong>Armored Magic</strong>
Focus have more latitude.</p>
<p>High Mages conduct extensive experimentation and study as
part of their daily activities. Each time they advance a level, they
may pick two High Magic spells from the list in this book to add
to their repertoire. These spells must be of a level they can cast.</p>
<p>High Mages also gain arts specific to their tradition. At first level,
a full High Mage picks two arts and a partial High Mage picks
one. As they gain levels and experience, they’ll learn additional
arts from the adjacent list. Once picked, an art cannot be changed.</p>
<h3 id="high-mage-arts"><a class="header" href="#high-mage-arts">High Mage Arts</a></h3>
<p>High Mage Effort is calculated as usual, with each PC’s maximum
being equal to one plus their Magic skill level plus the better of
their Intelligence or Charisma modifiers. Partial High Mages have
a score one point lower than this, albeit not less than one.</p>

<p><strong>Arcane Lexicon:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene. For the rest of the
scene, you can read any script that was not intentionally obfuscated
or encoded by its writer. Extremely esoteric or nonhuman scripts
may not be comprehensible this way; the “plain meaning” of the
text might be utterly foreign to human logic.</p>
<p><strong>Counter Magic:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action
when a visible enemy mage casts a spell. Both of you make opposed Int/Magic or Cha/Magic skill checks; if you win, their spell
fizzles and is wasted. This art only works on actual spellcasters and
not creatures that merely activate magical powers. You can use this
art no more than once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Empowered Sorcery:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to re-roll any variable die roll associated with a spell’s effects,
such as a damage roll; take the roll you prefer.</p>
<p><strong>Hang Sorcery:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action
when casting a spell. The spell does not go off, but remains “hung”
and waiting to be triggered as an On Turn action, with details of
targeting and effect determined at that time. Damage does not
disrupt a hung spell, but no additional spells can be cast until the
hung spell is released or allowed to dissipate.</p>
<p><strong>Inexorable Effect:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action
to force an enemy to re-roll a successful saving throw and take the
worse result. You may use this art only once per scene.</p>
<p><strong>Iron Resolution:</strong> Commit Effort for the day when injured or disturbed in combat; you may make a Physical saving throw to resist
spell disruption and ignore the damage for purposes of spellcasting.</p>
<p><strong>Preparatory Countermagic:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene when you are affected by a spell you have prepared, including when you
are standing in the area of effect of one of your own damaging spells.
You are unaffected by the spell’s direct effects.</p>
<p><strong>Psychic Conversion:</strong> Once per day as an On Turn action, expend
one casting slot to remove one point of accrued System Strain and
heal 2 hit points per level.</p>
<p><strong>Restrained Casting:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action
when casting a High Magic spell. You may do so in perfect silence
and without need for somatic gestures, though damage will still disrupt the casting.</p>
<p><strong>Retain Sorcery:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action
after casting a spell; it does not count against your casting limits for
the day. You can use this art no more than once per day, and the
stress of using it prevents you from casting another spell before the
end of your next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Sense Magic:</strong> Commit Effort as an Instant action; while it remains
committed, you can visually perceive magical energy and get a
one-sentence description of the effect of any standing magics or
magical items you inspect. The ambient magical energies in most
areas allow you to see clearly even in conditions of perfect darkness.</p>
<p><strong>Suppress Magic:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action and
target a visible or known magical effect within one hundred feet. The
effect is suppressed as if by the Extirpate Arcana spell for 1d6 rounds
plus the caster’s character level. Spells cast by more powerful casters
may not be successfully suppressed, as noted in the spell description.
The caster can attempt to suppress an effect only once.</p>
<p><strong>Swift Casting:</strong> Once per scene, you may Commit Effort for the day
to turn a spell that normally requires a Main Action to cast into an
On Turn action. You can cast no other spell this round and you can’t
use this art if you’ve already cast a spell this round or been injured
or otherwise disqualified from casting.</p>
<p><strong>Ward Allies:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to omit
up to six allies from the effects of an area-effect spell you cast, allowing them to avoid any damage or other negative effect that would
be directly produced by the spell. This does not protect them from
indirect consequences, however, such as destroying the building
they are standing in.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard’s Grandeur:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action. As long
as it remains Committed, you will not become dirty, sweaty, stained,
or rumpled regardless of the circumstances. Noxious substances will
slide off you without staining and you will remain comfortable regardless of your attire in any normal climate. You may sleep comfortably
without shelter or bedding as per the privation rules.</p>
<h2 id="the-elementalist"><a class="header" href="#the-elementalist">The Elementalist</a></h2>
<p>Elementalists are spellcasting Mages who focus on the manipulation of the material world around them. While they are capable of
using High Magic, their specialist spells focus chiefly on wielding
the classical elements of fire, air, water, and earth.</p>
<h3 id="elementalist-benefits"><a class="header" href="#elementalist-benefits">Elementalist Benefits</a></h3>
<p>All Elementalists gain Magic as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0,
or level-1 if was already level-0.</p>
<p>Elementalists can prepare and cast High Magic spells in addition to the spells specific to Elementalists. As usual for spellcasters,
Elementalists can’t cast spells or use arts while armored or holding
a shield.</p>
<p>Elementalists are not as talented at general High Magic research
as High Mages are, but their studies still bear fruit in time. Each time
they advance a level, they can pick a new High Magic spell or an
Elementalist spell to add to their spellbook. They must be able to
cast the spell to add it to their selection.</p>
<p>Elementalists gain the <strong>Elemental Resilience</strong> and <strong>Elemental Sparks</strong> arts as part of their basic training, and may pick one additional art from the list below. Further arts are learned as they
advance in character level, as given in the tables below. Once
chosen, an art cannot be changed.</p>
<h3 id="elementalist-arts"><a class="header" href="#elementalist-arts">Elementalist Arts</a></h3>
<p>Elementalist Effort is calculated as usual, with each PC’s maximum
being equal to one plus their Magic skill level plus the better of
their Intelligence or Charisma modifiers. Partial Elementalists have
a score one point lower than this, albeit not less than one.</p>
<p><strong>Elemental Resilience:</strong> You are unharmed by mundane extremes
of cold or by heat less than that of a furnace. You suffer only half
damage from magical or extremely intense flame or frost attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Elemental Sparks:</strong> You can conjure petty amounts of flame, water,
ice, stone, or wind, sufficient to do small tricks, chill drinks, light candles, or do other minor things. Conjured substances last no longer
than a scene, and conjured water cannot lastingly quench thirst. This
art cannot actually be useful in solving a problem or overcoming
a challenge more than once per game session.</p>

<p><strong>Beckoned Deluge:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action
to conjure a considerable amount of water at a visible point within fifty feet per caster level. This water is sufficient to drench one
10-foot cube of matter per character level, making non-magical
bowstrings useless, extinguishing flames, and inflicting 1d6 damage per caster level on fiery supernatural creatures. This water
persists indefinitely after its conjuration and is sufficient to hydrate
ten people per caster level.</p>
<p><strong>Earthsight:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action. For
the rest of the scene, you can see the outlines of solid objects even
in perfect darkness, and can peer through a number of feet of earth
or stone equal to your character level.</p>
<p><strong>Elemental Blast:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to
hurl a blast of some elemental force at a visible target within fifty feet
per character level. The attack is made with Magic as the combat
skill, Int, Cha, or Dex as the attribute, and a bonus to hit equal to
your character level. It is not hindered by melee foes. On a hit, the
attack does 1d6 damage plus your character level and attribute mod. The blast may have collateral effects on objects in the case of
hurled fire or a torrent of pressurized water, but any conjured matter
vanishes at the end of the round.</p>
<p><strong>Flamesight:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While the Effort
remains Committed, you can see thermal gradients sufficient to distinguish surfaces and living creatures, even in perfect darkness. Optionally, you may cause your own eyes to cast a light sufficient to
illuminate your surroundings clearly out to a range of 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Pavis of Elements:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action to conjure an
elemental barrier around yourself. The barrier improves your Armor
Class by +4 and remains as long as the Effort remains Committed.
This bonus stacks with other effects, but cannot increase AC above
18, regardless of the combinations.</p>
<p><strong>Petrifying Stare:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and
target a visible creature. The creature must make a Physical save or
become partially petrified, losing its Move action for a number of
rounds equal to half your caster level, rounded up. Flying creatures
are forced to land by this art and swimming creatures will inevitably
sink to the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Rune of Destruction:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action
and target an adjacent solid surface. A glowing rune the size of a
handprint forms on the surface and persists for one hour per caster
level. Any creature who gets within two feet of the rune will trigger
it, causing it to explode in a five-foot radius with an elemental force
of your choice and suffering 2d6 damage plus your caster level.
Creatures already within five feet of the rune when it is laid will not
trigger it until they re-enter the area, nor will the caster trigger their
own runes. Runes cannot overlap their areas of effect.</p>
<p><strong>Steps of Air:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action and
target a visible ally; for one round per caster level, the target can fly
at their usual movement rate. If the art ends while they are still in the
air, they descend harmlessly to the ground. This art may also be used
as an Instant action to negate falling damage for any single target.</p>
<p><strong>Stunning Shock:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and
target a visible creature within fifty feet per caster level. The target
creature must be wearing or holding at least a pound worth of conductive metal or be considerably dampened. An electrical bolt leaps
from the caster to stun the target, causing them to lose their next Main
Action. A Physical saving throw can mitigate the effect, causing the
target to lose their Move action instead of their Main. A creature can
be targeted only once per scene by this.</p>
<p><strong>Thermal Shield:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action to
immediately negate one instance of fire or frost damage to any single
visible ally or object. This defense lasts only long enough to nullify
the single instance of damage.</p>

<p><strong>Bonetalker:</strong> You can see and communicate with any undead creature, regardless of a shared language or the creature’s natural state
of invisibility. By Committing Effort for the scene you can sense the
surface thoughts of any visible undead, including an impression
of any commands or behavior it has been ordered to carry out.
Unintelligent undead will not attack you or your companions unless
specifically compelled to do so by a command or a master. Even
intelligent undead will generally pause at least for an initial parley
before attacking.</p>
<p><strong>Cold Flesh:</strong> You no longer require sleep and feel pain only in an
abstract sense. You can suffer no more than 2 points of damage
from any given instance of Shock and you have a natural Armor
Class equal to 12 plus half your level, rounded down.</p>
<p><strong>Consume Life Energy:</strong> By making a Punch attack or using a melee
weapon you have spent at least an hour properly consecrating,
you can absorb a portion of the damage you inflict on others
as healing to yourself. For each successful attack you make with
such implements, you heal 1d6 damage, up to a maximum of the
damage done by the attack. You cannot drain more life than the
target has remaining hit points.</p>
<p><strong>False Death:</strong> Commit Effort as an Instant action; while it remains
Committed you appear dead to all mundane examination. You
lose your Main Actions while “dead”, but can move and perceive
normally and do not need to eat, drink, breathe, or perform other
bodily functions. Poisons and diseases do not progress in you while
you are “dead”. You can maintain this state of death for up to one
day per level before needing at least an hour to recover.</p>
<p><strong>Gravesight:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action; while it remains
Committed, you can see the life energies of living creatures around
you as various glowing patterns, regardless of the mundane illumination available. You can perceive sicknesses, poisons, and other physical qualities on sight. As a side effect of this ability, you can see
normally even in perfect blackness.</p>
<p><strong>Keeper of the Gate:</strong> At your discretion, creatures within twenty
feet of you per character level that are Mortally Wounded will die
instantly and cannot be revived by magic or medicine. Conversely,
you can Commit Effort for the day to automatically stabilize any or
all within that range, increasing their System Strain by 1 point. This
benefit cannot aid creatures that have been dismembered, shredded,
or otherwise suffered unsurvivable injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Life Bridge:</strong> You can transfer life force between willing or helpless
participants. Commit Effort for the day; for the rest of the scene, you
can shift hit points from one willing or helpless target no smaller than
a dog to another as a Main Action, provided you are touching both.
You can shift enough hit points to Mortally Wound a donor, but you
can’t give more to the recipient than would refresh their maximum
allowed hit points.</p>
<p><strong>Master of Bones:</strong> Undead must roll twice to save versus your abilities
or spells and take the worse roll. You may Commit Effort for the scene
as an Instant action to negate any single attack, magical power or
spell an undead uses against you. Undead with more than twice as
many hit dice as you have levels cannot be foiled this way.</p>
<p><strong>Red Harvest:</strong> You are empowered by death. As an Instant action,
whenever an intelligent living creature with at least one hit die perishes
within fifty feet of you, Commit Effort for the day to either heal 1d6
plus your level in lost hit points or gain a +4 bonus on your next hit
roll this scene. This art cannot be stacked, and it can be used only
once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Unaging:</strong> You no longer naturally age, and will remain perfectly
hale and vigorous up to your species’ natural maximum age plus
20% per character level, after which you will collapse into dust and
decay. Immortality beyond this point is possible, but generally requires consistent supplies of life energy, occult materials, or other difficult-to-acquire or morally questionable materials. You also become
immune to poisons and diseases.</p>
<p><strong>Uncanny Ichor:</strong> Your blood is not like the blood of normal beings.
Predators find it nauseating and will not bite you unless provoked. Unintelligent predators will not consider you edible. This ichor is reluctant
to leave your body, and stabbing or puncture injuries can Mortally
Wound you but cannot result in your death unless you are entirely
pincushioned by your foes or suffer catastrophic physical damage.</p>
<p><strong>Unliving Persistence:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn
action to automatically stabilize when Mortally Wounded. You may
use this ability to benefit others if you are able to touch them. This
ability cannot save a subject that has experienced dismemberment
or other extremely final deaths.</p>
<h2 id="the-invoker"><a class="header" href="#the-invoker">The Invoker</a></h2>
<p>The Invoker is an optional spellcasting Mage class that allows a
caster to gain flexibility in casting weaker spells. In exchange, an
Invoker sacrifices arts and finds more powerful spells to be more
draining to cast.</p>
<h3 id="invoker-benefits"><a class="header" href="#invoker-benefits">Invoker Benefits</a></h3>
<p>All Invokers gain Magic as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0, or
level-1 if was already level-0. Their arcane versatility requires a
thorough grounding in theory.</p>
<p>Invokers can learn and prepare spells of the High Magic tradition, and have the same limits on casting in armor as they do. Each
Invoker can prepare a number of known spells as indicated by the
table each day, plus their Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p>Each Invoker has a number of spell points based on their level,
to which is added their Intelligence modifier. When they cast the
spell, they subtract its level from their available spell points for the
day. So long as they have sufficient spell points left, they can cast
the same spell repeatedly. Spell points refresh each morning.</p>
<p>Invokers do not normally gain arts; their versatility requires complete focus, barring those who take the Invoker-specific <strong>Traditional Education</strong> Focus. While it’s possible to be a Partial Invoker, this partial class may not be mixed with another partial spellcasting class.</p>
<p>Invokers begin play knowing four first level High Magic spells,
or two if a partial class. When they advance a level, they learn
two more of any level or tradition from which they can cast, or one
if a partial Invoker.</p>

<p>Your Invoker has received a great deal of education in a specialist
arcane spellcasting tradition such as High Magic arts, Elementalism
or Necromancy. Only Invokers can take this Focus, and it can only
be taken once.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1:</strong> You may learn and prepare spells of your chosen tradition as well as those of High Magic. You gain arts as if a first level
practitioner of that tradition, full or partial based on whether you’re
a full or partial Invoker, and your maximum Effort score is equal to
your Magic skill, to a minimum of 1. You cannot gain further arts
from this tradition.</p>
<h2 id="the-accursed"><a class="header" href="#the-accursed">The Accursed</a></h2>
<p>The Accursed are those men and women who have made pacts
with otherworldly beings, intentionally or otherwise, and gained
powers from that bond.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-the-accursed"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-the-accursed">Benefits of the Accursed</a></h3>
<p>The Accursed is a partial Mage class that must be joined with a
second partial class by an Adventurer. A Partial Warrior/Accursed
might be a grim demonic warrior, a Partial Expert/Accursed might
be a sinister tempter, while a Partial Mage/Accursed could be a
sorcerer willing to pact with foul creatures for their powers.</p>
<p>All Accursed gain Magic-0 during character creation. Even
those who are not spellcasters must understand the ways of eldritch
beings and the subtleties of sorcery.</p>
<p>While the arts of <strong>Accursed Blade</strong> and <strong>Accursed Bolt</strong> use
Magic as their combat skill, Foci that normally apply to mundane
weapons such as Armsmaster or Deadeye also benefit their relevant
melee or ranged attacks. For these Foci, read “Magic” in place
of “Shoot” or “Stab” when gaining their benefits, including the
granted skill and the stacking damage bonus that the first level of
the Focus may grant.</p>
<h3 id="accursed-arts"><a class="header" href="#accursed-arts">Accursed Arts</a></h3>
<p>An Accursed has an Effort score equal to their Magic skill level plus
their Intelligence or Charisma modifier, to a minimum of one point.
Every Accursed gains either <strong>Accursed Bolt</strong> or <strong>Accursed Blade</strong>
as a starting art, plus one more of their choice. Accursed arts may
be used in or out of armor.</p>
<p><strong>Accursed Blade:</strong> As an On Turn action, manifest an occult melee
weapon as a one-handed 1d8 weapon or a two-handed 2d6
weapon. Both add your Magic skill to the damage roll, have a
Shock rating of 2/15, and use Magic as the attack skill and the
best of Str, Dex, Int, or Cha as its modifying attribute.</p>
<p><strong>Accursed Bolt:</strong> As Accursed Blade, but you launch blasts of occult
force instead of meleeing. Their damage is 1d8 plus your Magic
skill, their range is 200’, and the bolts can be thrown in melee at
a -4 penalty to hit. These bolts need both hands free to hurl them.</p>
<p><strong>Bewitching Distraction:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main
Action when talking to an intelligent target when not in combat.
They must make a Mental save or become dazed, oblivious to their
surroundings and forgetting you and all else that happened in that
scene. Danger ends the daze but not the forgetting.</p>
<p><strong>Compelling Shriek:</strong> Once per scene, Commit Effort for the day as
a Main Action and shout a command of no more than seven words.
Chosen targets who hear and understand must make a Mental
save or perform that action for one round, provided it is not totally
contrary to their character.</p>
<p><strong>Devil’s Bargain:</strong> As a Main Action, consecrate a deal you’ve
made with an uncoerced person. If they violate the deal or its
spirit, you know instantly and may inflict 1d6 damage per level
on them if desired.</p>
<p><strong>Dire Pact:</strong> Foes suffer a penalty equal to your Magic skill on all
saves versus your Accursed arts. If they succeed, however, you
gain one System Strain.</p>
<p><strong>Lying Face:</strong> Commit Effort as a Main Action; while it remains Committed, you can disguise yourself as any humanoid of the same
general size, including clothing, scent, and voice.</p>
<p><strong>Night-Black Eyes:</strong> You can see clearly in perfect darkness. As a Main Action, focus on a particular visible object, person, or location; you can tell if it is enchanted, though no details about the
magic are seen.</p>
<p><strong>Pacted Protection:</strong> Choose a type of harmful energy: fire, frost,
acid, electricity, or the like. You become immune to natural degrees of this energy and take half damage from magical attacks
involving it.</p>
<p><strong>Rob Vitality:</strong> Once per scene, as an On Turn action, Commit Effort
for the scene and target a visible foe. They must make a Physical
save or lose their next Main Action, which you immediately gain
instead.</p>
<p><strong>Scourging Curse:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action
and target a visible foe. Your curse inflicts a -1 penalty to their hit,
damage, and saving throw rolls for one round per level. At 4th level
this penalty becomes -2, and at 9th it becomes -3. Only one such
curse can be active at a given time.</p>
<p><strong>Shadowed Steps:</strong> As a Move Action, Commit Effort for the scene
and teleport up to your Move distance. You cannot bypass walls
or physical obstacles, but you can teleport vertically or into high
places.</p>
<p><strong>Snaring Speech:</strong> Once per round as an Instant action, Commit
Effort for the day when failing a skill check to persuade or tempt
someone. They must make a Mental save or agree with your proposal if it’s something they would normally consider doing. Gain
one System Strain when using this art.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerous Battery:</strong> Once per day, as an On Turn action, Commit
Effort for the day. You or a visible ally refresh the spell slot of a
spell that has been cast since the start of the prior round. Gain one
System Strain.</p>
<p><strong>Soul Consumption:</strong> As an Instant action, Commit Effort for the day
when you fell an intelligent target with Accursed Bolt or Accursed
Blade. They die instantly. You heal 1d6 hit points plus your level
and lose one accumulated System Strain.</p>
<p><strong>Tendrils of Night:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While
Committed, you exude numerous tentacles or eldritch arms that can
manipulate objects with your strength up to 20’ away. You gain no
bonus actions, but the arms can melee at range. These arms have
your AC, and you are damaged if they are hurt.</p>
<p><strong>Unseen Steps:</strong> As an On Turn action, Commit Effort for the day to
turn invisible for 1d6 rounds plus your level. This invisibility breaks
before you attack, cast spells, or perform other vigorous or violent
actions.</p>
<p><strong>Weight of Sin:</strong> As a Main Action, Commit Effort for the day and
target a visible foe. They must make a Physical save or lose their
Move action for 1d6 rounds plus your level.</p>
<p><strong>Weeping Wounds:</strong> Once per round, Commit Effort for the scene
as an Instant action when a visible enemy takes damage. They
must make a Physical save or suffer 1d6 damage per round for
one round per level. They cannot heal or regenerate any hit point
damage during this effect. This art does not stack.</p>
<h2 id="the-beastmaster"><a class="header" href="#the-beastmaster">The Beastmaster</a></h2>
<p>Beastmasters are those PCs with an unnatural ability to control and
influence animals. For some, these abilities are the fruit of rigorous
magical study, while others obtain them from cultural practices, a
feral upbringing, or natural aptitude.</p>
<h3 id="beastmaster-benefits"><a class="header" href="#beastmaster-benefits">Beastmaster Benefits</a></h3>
<p>The Beastmaster exists only as a partial Mage class, meant to be
taken by an Adventurer along with another partial class. A Partial
Warrior/Beastmaster may be a savage barbarian or wood-wise
ranger, while a Partial Expert/Beastmaster might be a masterful
hunter or zoologist.</p>
<p>All Beastmasters get Survive as a bonus skill at level-0, or at
level-1 if they already have it at level-0. The amount of time they
spend in the wilderness learning of its ways can’t help but teach
them how to survive in hard conditions and navigate the perils of
an untamed land.</p>
<h3 id="beastmaster-companions"><a class="header" href="#beastmaster-companions">Beastmaster Companions</a></h3>
<p>Many Beastmaster arts apply to the PC’s animal companion. There
are a few basic guidelines for such companions that a GM should
keep in mind during play.</p>
<p>A companion animal cannot have a number of hit dice greater
than the Beastmaster’s level plus one. Thus a 2 hit die wolf is an
acceptable companion for a first-level Beastmaster, but a 5 hit die
tentacular horror is too potent to be bound to service.</p>
<p>A companion animal cannot have human levels of intelligence.
It must be more-or-less animal in its thought patterns, though it can
be a magical beast or supernatural entity of some kind.</p>
<p>A Beastmaster can normally have only one companion animal at
a time. They can leave an animal behind in any terrain suitable for
its survival and expect it to be in the same vicinity later if they choose
to return for it and no one has killed it in the meanwhile. Released
creatures are usually friendly to the Beastmaster still, unless they
have been mistreated or are exceptionally savage.</p>
<p>A companion animal functions as an independent allied creature.
It will obey commands from the Beastmaster that are not contrary
to its own nature or beyond its intellect, but it will fight, move, check
Instinct and Morale as normal, and act independently in combat.
If the creature is mistreated or used as mere cannon fodder, it can
flee or turn on its former master.</p>
<p>A companion animal must be given a name by the Beastmaster. Without a name to focus the PC’s arts, the creature cannot be
controlled.</p>
<h3 id="the-chosen-friend"><a class="header" href="#the-chosen-friend">The Chosen Friend</a></h3>
<p>Some Beastmasters form a lifelong bond with a single dear companion. If a PC chooses this option, they can only ever Bind one
companion, but it gains the benefit of the <strong>Shared Vitality</strong> and
<strong>Mind Call</strong> arts automatically. So long as the Beastmaster lives,
this chosen friend cannot truly die; if reduced to zero hit points, it
disappears, but will manifest again at the Beastmaster’s side the
following dawn with its full hit points. Of course, the master is expected to treat this companion as the beloved friend it is, and not
as mere battle-fodder.</p>
<h3 id="beastmaster-arts"><a class="header" href="#beastmaster-arts">Beastmaster Arts</a></h3>
<p>Beastmaster Effort is calculated with Survive, and is equal to the
PC’s Survive skill level plus the higher of their Wisdom or Charisma
modifiers, to a minimum of one point. All Beastmasters start play
with the <strong>Bind Companion</strong> art and one more of their choosing. They
learn additional arts as they gain experience. Unlike some Mage
traditions, Beastmasters can use their arts normally while armored.</p>
<p><strong>Bind Companion:</strong> With a day’s work in a location you can find
and bind a suitable animal companion. If looking for a particular
type of companion, it must be found in the area and may require
a Wis/Survive skill check at a difficulty of 10 or more if it’s a particularly rare creature. If you encounter a suitable animal on an
adventure, you may bind it as a Main Action, with the creature
allowed a Mental saving throw to resist and become impervious
to your powers. You may release a companion as a Main Action
if you no longer wish its service or want to bind a different beast.</p>

<p><strong>Beast Ward:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action. So long as the
Effort remains Committed, the Beastmaster will not be attacked by
unintelligent beasts unless the beast is commanded to do so by its
master, the beast is starving, or the Beastmaster or their allies performs some hostile act against it. Once the ward ends or is broken,
it cannot be re-established in the same scene. Magical beasts and
those trained specifically as guardians of an area get a Mental
save to resist this power.</p>
<p><strong>Eyes of the Beast:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action.
For the rest of the scene, you can share the senses of your companion. Neither of you can be surprised unless both are surprised.</p>
<p><strong>Feral Toughness:</strong> Your maximum hit point total is increased by
the natural, unmodified hit dice of your companion; thus, a 5 hit
die companion increases your maximum hit points by 5. You are
impervious to normal outdoor extremes of heat or cold. Your base
Armor Class is equal to 13 plus half your level, rounded up. This AC
can be modified by shields or Dexterity modifiers, but not by armor.</p>
<p><strong>Howl of Distant Summons:</strong> You can call former animal companions to your side by Committing Effort for the day as a Main
Action. The howl extends through time as well as space, and the
subject will have received the message in time to reach your side
within five minutes after you call for it. Once summoned, you may
bind it again if you have no current companion. If the journey is
exceptionally dangerous, difficult, or long, you’ll need to make a
Cha/Survive skill check against a difficulty of 10 or more; on a
failure, the beast could not make the journey and cannot be called
by this power for another week.</p>
<p><strong>Know the Weak Spot:</strong> Whenever inflicting damage on a beast
with a weapon or physical attack, roll the damage twice and take
the higher score. Optionally, Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action when an ally within earshot hits a beast; your shouted
advice or distracting help allows them to roll damage twice and
take the better result as well.</p>
<p><strong>Mind Call:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action. For
the rest of the scene you forge a telepathic bond with your animal
companion. You can give it orders and receive information from the
creature, at least insofar as its limited intellect allows.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Weaponry:</strong> You may have physically grown fangs and
claws, or it may be that you just intuitively absorbed effective unarmed fighting techniques from your animal companions. When
unarmed, your attacks count as weapons that use either Str or Dex as their modifier, use Punch or Stab as the skill, do 1d8 damage,
and have a Shock value of 2/AC 13. These unarmed attacks can
harm even creatures immune to non-magical weapons. The damage
and Shock of these weapons gains a +1 bonus at level 3, a +2
bonus at level 6, and a +3 bonus at level 9.</p>
<p><strong>Savage Senses:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action.
For the remainder of the scene you are capable of seeing clearly
even in pitch blackness, can scent out trails and belongings as
perfectly as a wolf could, and gain a +2 bonus on all Notice skill
checks involving sight, sound, or smell.</p>
<p><strong>Shared Vitality:</strong> The animal companions you bind have hit dice no
lower than your level, even if they normally have far fewer. Thus, a 2
hit die beast bound by a 7th level Beastmaster would have 7 hit dice
while it remained bound. Its hit bonus can’t be less than half its hit
dice, rounded up. A Beastmaster can stabilize a Mortally Wounded
companion by Committing Effort for the scene as an Instant action.</p>
<p><strong>Swift Healing:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action to heal
1d6 damage per character level to a wounded companion. This
healing can be extended only once per scene or fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Tongue of the Beasts:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While
the Effort remains committed, you can speak with any animal that
has fur, feathers, scales, or skin. This art allows them to temporarily
speak as if they had human intellect, though their interests, knowledge, and desires do not change.</p>
<h2 id="the-blood-priest"><a class="header" href="#the-blood-priest">The Blood Priest</a></h2>
<p>As the devotee of a sanguinary god, a blood priest has magical
powers for strengthening and supporting their allies.</p>
<h3 id="blood-priest-benefits"><a class="header" href="#blood-priest-benefits">Blood Priest Benefits</a></h3>
<p>The Blood Priest exists only as a partial Mage class, to be taken by
an Adventurer alongside another partial class. A Partial Warrior/
Blood Priest might be a crusader for their god, wielding steel and
terror against the evils of this world. A Partial Expert/Blood Priest
might be an inquisitor, investigating dubious figures and sifting out
the truth of mysterious events.</p>
<p>All Blood Priests gain Pray as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0,
or level-1 if they already have it at level-0. Even a “Blood Priest”
who has only learned their abilities through study of their scriptures
must master a wide variety of ecclesiastical rites and rituals in order
to activate their powers.</p>
<h3 id="blood-priest-arts"><a class="header" href="#blood-priest-arts">Blood Priest Arts</a></h3>
<p>Blood Priest Effort is calculated with Pray, with their total maximum
Effort being equal to their Pray skill plus the higher of their Wisdom
or Charisma modifiers, to a minimum of one point.</p>
<p>At first level, the Blood Priest may choose two of the following
miracles to master, and gain more as they advance in levels. Once
chosen, a miracle pick is permanent and cannot be changed later.
Miracles are not hindered by the wearing of armor and require no
gestures or free hand to employ, though usually a prayer must be
vocalized as part of the action.</p>

<p><strong>A Thousand Tongues:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action; while
it remains Committed, you can speak with and understand any
sentient creature with a language of their own. To any listener, it
will seem as if you are perfectly fluent in their own language, even
as you speak in your own native tongue. This ability does not allow
you to read or write unknown languages.</p>
<p><strong>Armor of God:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While the
Effort remains Committed, you have a natural Armor Class of 15
plus half your level, rounded down. This AC can be modified by
shields or your Dexterity modifier, but not by other worn armor.</p>
<p><strong>Divine Guidance:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and
meditate upon a choice or potential action before you. The GM will
tell you whether the likely outcome of that choice is weal, woe, a
mix of both, or nothing significant, using their own best estimation.
This insight cannot perceive likely outcomes more than an hour or
so into the future.</p>
<p><strong>Fear No Flame:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action
while nominating a visible target. For the rest of the scene, they are
immune to non-magical flame, smoke, or explosive damage, and
decrease any sources of such magical damage they take by five
points per level of Pray you have.</p>
<p><strong>God Wills It:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action and
loudly call down your god’s blessing on your comrades. For the
rest of the scene, up to six allies per character level in earshot gain
an effective Morale of 12 and a +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls,
including any Shock that may be inflicted. At fifth level this becomes
a +2 bonus, and at tenth level it becomes a +3 bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Merciful Healing:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and
touch a target within melee range. The target receives 1d6+2 points
of magical healing. If done in combat or used to revive a Mortally
Wounded subject, the rushed haste of the healing adds 1 System Strain to the target, but no System Strain is added if it is applied
outside of combat. At fourth level the healing done increases to
2d6+4 and at eighth level it becomes 4d6+8.</p>
<p><strong>Sanctified Ward:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While the
Effort is maintained and until you take some hostile action against a
creature, you are immune to Shock damage and gain a +4 bonus
to your Armor Class and all saving throws. Enemies must pass an
Instinct check each round to target you with attacks; on a failure,
they may take some other action instead. Once this art is ended it
cannot be reactivated for the rest of the scene. Healing and other
indirect support of fighting comrades does not count as a hostile
action.</p>
<p><strong>Smite the Wicked:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a On Turn action
whenever you attack or take some damaging action toward a single
target. You gain a +4 bonus to any hit roll, you inflict your character
level as automatic damage, and you can roll any damage dice
twice and take the higher result. This ability can only be used once
per scene on a given target.</p>
<p><strong>The Light of Faith:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action; while it remains Committed, you can cast a clear, bright radiance that extends
up to thirty feet away from you. At your discretion, this light is visible
only to you and your comrades, including up to a dozen allies.</p>
<p><strong>Transubstantiation:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action to
transform up to a gallon of any liquid into sacred blood. A draught
of this holy liquid is sufficient to sustain a drinker for a day without
further food or drink and will heal 1d6 plus the user’s Pray skill in
lost hit points. A gallon of blood is sufficient to help a half-dozen
people. The benefits of this art can be enjoyed only once per day,
and any undrunk blood sublimates away within a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Turn False Life:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and
make the sign of your god before one or more visible targets within
sixty feet. Roll 2d6 and add your character level; that many hit dice
of undead, automatons, or other synthetic, extraplanar, or unnatural
life forms must make Mental saving throws or cower for the rest of
the scene or until they or their comrades are attacked. Cowering
enemies will take no hostile action and may flee unless bound to
their location. This power does not affect foes with twice as many
hit dice as the blood priest has levels. If the rolled hit die total isn’t
enough to fully affect a creature, it is unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>Words of Mercy:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action
to reroll any failed social skill check related to maintaining peace,
granting help, or encouraging virtuous acts of compassion, mercy,
or truthfulness. This art can be used only once on any given skill
check.</p>
<p><strong>Wrath of the Most High:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as a Main
Action while you rebuke a visible target. The first time the target
takes damage before the end of the next round, it suffers automatic
additional damage equal to 1d8 plus your level.</p>
<h2 id="the-duelist"><a class="header" href="#the-duelist">The Duelist</a></h2>
<p>Some warriors indulge in unique training methods that draw on
arcane forces to enhance their speed and agility.</p>
<h3 id="duelist-benefits"><a class="header" href="#duelist-benefits">Duelist Benefits</a></h3>
<p>The Duelist is a partial Mage class, meant to be taken by an Adventurer in conjunction with another partial class. Partial Warrior/
Duelist is the most common pairing, for a skilled light-armor combatant with high mobility and a number of useful combat techniques.
Partial Expert/Duelist might represent an assassin who relies on
stealth as much as steel, while a rare few Mage/Duelist combinations speak of adventuring wizards who perhaps have more talent
for the sword than for the spell.</p>
<p>All Duelists gain Stab as a bonus skill. No Duelist worth the name
is entirely incapable of effective use of melee weapons, though the
style lends itself heavily to specialization.</p>
<h3 id="the-flaw-of-fragility"><a class="header" href="#the-flaw-of-fragility">The Flaw of Fragility</a></h3>
<p>While the canons of the duelist make for an excellent one-on-one
combatant, their practitioners spend much less time at raw physical
conditioning than their more traditional warrior peers. The techniques they use are swift and lethal, but they aren’t as generally
applicable to enduring harm as are standard training methods.</p>
<p>As such, Partial Warriors/Partial Duelists use 1d6 for their hit
dice, rather than the Partial Warrior’s usual 1d6+2. Other partial
class mixes are unaffected by this flaw.</p>
<h3 id="duelist-arts"><a class="header" href="#duelist-arts">Duelist Arts</a></h3>
<p>Duelist Effort is based on Stab, and is equal to the PC’s Stab skill
plus the highest of their Dexterity or Intelligence modifiers, to a minimum of one point. All Duelists begin with the <strong>Favored Weapon</strong>
art and one more of their choice. Additional arts are learned as
the PC advances in experience.</p>
<p>The arts of the Duelist require agility and free motion. The Duelist
cannot benefit from any art of this class while wearing medium or
heavy armor or carrying a large shield. Dual-wielding is practiced
by some Duelists, but most prefer the defensive advantages of a
small offhand shield.</p>
<p><strong>Favored Weapon:</strong> Choose one specific type of non-unarmed melee weapon. You begin play with such a weapon, and when using
this type you may use the Favored Weapon attack bonus column
on the Duelist table to determine your base hit bonus, unless it’s
already better for some other reason. If your second partial class
is Partial Warrior, your class’ base hit bonus with the weapon is
instead equal to your level. You cannot apply this or other Duelist
arts to thrown weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Blood for Blood:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action
when an enemy hits you with a physical attack. If you attack that
enemy with your favored weapon before the end of the next round,
the first blow hits automatically and can do no less damage than
was done to you, up to the weapon’s maximum.</p>
<p><strong>Burst of Speed:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action.

twice, taking the better result. Once the Code Duello has been
disrupted or ended, it cannot be invoked again during that scene.</p>
<p><strong>Crushing Superiority:</strong> Your favored weapon gains the Less Lethal
quality if it doesn’t already have it. Commit Effort for the scene as
an Instant action when you hit a target; they must immediately make
an Instinct check. This ability can be used only once per scene on
any given target.</p>
<p><strong>Dauntless Step:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action.
The Move actions you make for the rest of the round can cross
vertical surfaces or difficult terrain at your full normal movement
rate, provided you end the round standing upright on a surface
that can bear your weight.</p>
<p><strong>Dodge Doom:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action when
caught in some explosion or other burst effect. You take half damage, or no damage if the effect allows a save and you succeed at
it. You can move yourself up to ten feet away from your original
location, provided the new location is behind cover or away from
the blast’s point of origin.</p>
<p><strong>Forced Engagement:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant
action when making an attack with your favored weapon; you may
ignore one foe’s Screen Ally action for that attack.</p>
<p><strong>Gentleman’s Withdrawal:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as a Move
action. As part of this, you may move at your full movement rate
without being hindered by armed foes unless they completely block
your path. You count as having made a Fighting Withdrawal against
any enemies engaged with you at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Graceful Leap:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action to
immediately leap up to ten feet horizontally or vertically, counting it
as a Fighting Withdrawal. You can’t use this art more than once per
round or after you’ve attacked. You are immune to falling damage
from plunges of less than 30 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Lightning Draw:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action at
the start of hostilities; you win initiative against anyone without a
similar ability to act first and may ready a Stowed favored weapon
Instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Piercing Strike:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action
and choose a visible target. For the rest of the scene, their AC is
treated as 10 for purposes of resisting the Shock of your favored
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual Weapon:</strong> You are able to translate examples of your
favored weapon into a spiritual template that you may manifest as
you wish. Any favored weapon can be turned into such a template,
including a magical weapon, but the process destroys the object’s
physical form. To manifest a template, Commit Effort as an Instant
action; a ghostly copy of the weapon appears Readied in hand
for you until you release the Effort or stop touching the weapon.
Dual-wielders can summon the same weapon into both hands with
one use of this art.</p>
<p><strong>Unbindable:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action whenever you wish to escape chains, grapples, shackles, ropes, or even
a magical spell of physical binding. You automatically wriggle
free from mundane restraints and gain an Evasion saving throw to
instantly end a physical magical binding of some sort. You can use
this art only once per round.</p>
<p><strong>Unworthy Rabble:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action.
For the rest of the scene, when using your favored weapon, reroll
any failed hit roll against foes with one hit die. At eighth level, this
ability applies to foes with two hit dice.</p>
<p><strong>Whirling Evasion:</strong> Your base Armor Class becomes equal to 13
plus half your level, rounded up. This AC can be modified by small
shields and your Dexterity modifier, but not by armor or large
shields.</p>
<h2 id="the-healer"><a class="header" href="#the-healer">The Healer</a></h2>
<p>The Healer is a partial Mage class that does not use spells. Instead,
they gain specific arts that allow them to mend wounds, cure illnesses, and otherwise sustain their allies.</p>
<h3 id="healer-benefits"><a class="header" href="#healer-benefits">Healer Benefits</a></h3>
<p>The Healer class exists only as a partial Mage class, to be taken
by an Adventurer along with another partial class. Thus, a Partial
Warrior/Partial Healer might be a grizzled combat medic, a Partial
Expert/Partial Healer might be an erudite physician gifted in both
mundane and magical healing methods, and a Partial Necromancer/Partial Healer might be an adept of life and death.</p>
<p>All Healers gain Heal as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0,
or level-1 if they already have it at level-0. A basic grounding in
mundane healing techniques is necessary in order to learn their
more sophisticated magical arts.</p>
<p>Healers do not learn how to cast spells. Instead, they focus
on their special arcane healing arts. Wielding these arts usually
requires nothing more than touching the target and concentrating
on the desired effect, and the process is direct and simple enough
to perform even when burdened by armor or carrying a shield.
These arts are usually quite subtle, and don’t produce visible or
audible indications of their use.</p>
<p>At first level, a Healer gains the <strong>Healing Touch</strong> art and can
pick one more of their choice. As they advance in levels afterwards,
they can learn new arts. Once chosen, an art is permanent and
cannot be exchanged.</p>
<h3 id="healer-arts"><a class="header" href="#healer-arts">Healer Arts</a></h3>
<p>Healer Effort is calculated with Heal rather than Magic, with each
PC’s maximum being equal to their Heal skill level plus the better of
their Intelligence or Charisma modifiers, to a minimum of one point.</p>
<p>All Healers are trained in the <strong>Healing Touch</strong> art, but may develop other techniques with time.</p>
<p><strong>Healing Touch:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action;
for the rest of the scene, you may heal 2d6 damage plus your Heal
skill to a touched ally as a Main Action. This healing adds 1 System
Strain to the target each time it is applied.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Empowered Healer:</strong> Your Healing Touch becomes more powerful,
adding your level to any healing.</p>
<p><strong>Facile Healer:</strong> Your Healing Touch ability is improved;, and you
no longer need to Commit Effort to activate it.</p>
<p><strong>Far Healer:</strong> Your Healing Touch ability is improved, and may be
used on a visible target within ten feet per character level.</p>
<p><strong>Final Repose:</strong> Target a visible living creature and Commit Effort
for the day as an Instant action. For the rest of the scene, they take
a Physical saving throw penalty equal to your Heal skill. If they are
reduced to zero hit points before the end of the scene, they die with
no chance for stabilization or revival.</p>
<p><strong>Healer’s Eye:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action; while the Effort
remains committed, you can use a Main Action to visually detect
diseases and poisons, diagnose creatures flawlessly, perceive their
physiology, and learn their current hit point totals. As a side effect,
you can detect living creatures by sight regardless of available
light or obscuring mists.</p>
<p><strong>Limb Restoration:</strong> Only expert healers can master this art, which cannot be learned earlier than 8th level. You must Commit all remaining Effort for the day, a minimum of one point, to regenerate a
missing limb or organ for a target you are touching, or efface some
dramatic scar or other physical debility. The target’s System Strain is
automatically maximized.</p>
<p><strong>Purge Ailment:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action. An ally
you are touching is cured of one poison or disease. Creatures killed
by poison can be revived by this art if it is used within six minutes of
death. Magical poisons and diseases may require a Wis/Heal or
Cha/Heal skill check against a difficulty of 8 or more. At seventh
level, you need only Commit Effort for the scene to use this ability.</p>
<p><strong>Refined Restoration:</strong> You and up to a dozen allies you tend before they sleep will all lose 2 System Strain from a good night’s rest
instead of 1.</p>
<p><strong>Revive the Fallen:</strong> Only expert healers are capable of mastering
this art, which cannot be learned earlier than 8th level. Commit
Effort for the day as a Main Action to revive a recently-slain living
creature that you are touching. This ability must be used on a target
within one minute per caster level of their death, and will not work
on a corpse that has been dismembered, incinerated, or otherwise
disjected. The target’s System Strain is automatically maximized and
they’ll be unconscious for twenty-four hours after their restoration
before awakening with 1 hit point.</p>
<p><strong>Swift Healer:</strong> Your Healing Touch ability is improved, and may be
used as an On Turn action once per day per character level, though
not more than once per round on any given target.</p>
<p><strong>The Healer’s Knife:</strong> Your Healing Touch ability is altered, and may
be used to inflict damage to a living target instead of healing it. The
damage done is equivalent to the healing that would normally be
done, albeit you receive 1 System Strain instead of the target. Using
this power in melee requires a successful Punch attack with a hit
bonus equal to your Heal skill, with the damage added to any done
by the blow, or simply touching an unwary target. Ranged use with
Far Healer is impossible with this art.</p>
<p><strong>Tireless Vigor:</strong> Commit Effort; while it remains Committed your need
to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep does not grow further. You may exert
yourself tirelessly and regenerate 1 lost hit point per hour.</p>
<p><strong>Vital Furnace:</strong> Your tremendous life energy can be used to instantly
regenerate any non-mortal wound you have received. Commit Effort
for the day as an Instant action to negate the damage from an injury
you just received that did not reduce you to zero hit points. Aside from
this ability, you automatically stabilize if reduced to zero hit points
and awaken ten minutes later with 1 hit point. This ability cannot
undo damage you intentionally inflict on yourself via some power
or magical exchange.</p>
<h2 id="the-skinshifter"><a class="header" href="#the-skinshifter">The Skinshifter</a></h2>
<p>The Skinshifter is a partial Mage class that grants the user shapeshifting abilities, whether to adopt the form of beasts or configurations
of their own devising.</p>
<h3 id="skinshifter-benefits"><a class="header" href="#skinshifter-benefits">Skinshifter Benefits</a></h3>
<p>Skinshifter is a partial Mage class, meant to be taken by an Adventurer in conjunction with another partial class. A Partial Warrior/
Skinshifter might be a shapeshifting assassin or feral savage warrior, while a Partial Expert/Skinshifter could be an undetectable
impostor or con artist.</p>
<p>All Skinshifters gain Survive-0 as a bonus skill, or Survive-1 if
they already have Survive-0 as a skill.</p>
<h3 id="skinshifter-forms"><a class="header" href="#skinshifter-forms">Skinshifter Forms</a></h3>
<p>The arts of a Skinshifter revolve around improving or adjusting their
alternate forms. These alternate forms have a few basic rules that
apply to all their permutations.</p>
<p>A Skinshifter can master one alternate form per character level.
A Skinshifter who wants to change a form selection can do so with
a day of careful practice and adjustment. Skinshifter PCs should
note down the special powers or traits of their alternate forms and
keep in mind which of them they have available at any one time.</p>
<p>A Skinshifter’s alternate forms use the same hit points, character
attributes, and movement speed as their normal form, unless modified by particular arts. Thus, a Skinshifter shifted into a wolf’s shape
would do no more damage with its bite than the human’s unarmed
attack would do without some augmenting art. Alternate forms do
grant a minimum level of combat competence, however, and so
the “Form Bonus” hit bonus is used in place of the PC’s basic class
hit bonus when in a non-humanoid shape, assuming they don’t
already have a better basic bonus from their other partial class.</p>
<p>Arts that improve the alternate forms can apply their benefits
even if the creature’s natural shape wouldn’t normally grant it. Thus,
a Skinshifter with the Manifest Wings art could have a wolf-form
that had wings and a flying speed if they wished. A given form can
have no more than three arts applied to it.</p>
<p>A Skinshifter’s alternate forms can be any size between a horse
and a kitten, barring modification by some art. They do not need
to emulate a specific type of creature; a Skinshifter could have a
clawed and winged humanoid form as an alternate shape, or a
dog with the head of a man, or a cat with razor-sharp mandibles.</p>
<p>The belongings carried by a Skinshifter meld into any new form
unless the PC decides otherwise, granting any benefit to Armor
Class or other worn advantage they may normally give. Melded
objects can be manifested and dropped as an On Turn action,
but cannot be re-melded again unless the PC changes form with
them again.</p>
<p>Skinshifter forms cannot perfectly duplicate another individual creature without an appropriate art.</p>
<h3 id="skinshifter-arts"><a class="header" href="#skinshifter-arts">Skinshifter Arts</a></h3>
<p>Skinshifter Effort is based on Survive, and is equal to the PC’s Survive skill level plus the highest of their Constitution or Charisma
modifiers, to a minimum of one point. All Skinshifters begin play
with the <strong>Change Form</strong> art and one more of their choice. Additional
arts are learned as the PC advances in experience.</p>
<p><strong>Change Form:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action to transform into an available Alternate form. This shift persists until you die,
shift to a new form, or end the transformation as an On Turn action.
Your hit points, System Strain, and other scores remain the same in
any new form, but in a non-humanoid form your class’ base attack
bonus can be no worse than the one listed on the table. If your shape
is quadrupedal, its Move is 10’ faster than your base.</p>

<p><strong>Eyes of the Hawk:</strong> This shape has remarkably acute senses. You can
scent trails and objects like a dog, hear very faint noises, see objects
clearly enough to identify faces at a thousand feet of distance, and
see clearly in anything short of complete darkness. You gain a +2
bonus on all sensory Notice checks.</p>
<p><strong>Feline Leap:</strong> This form can vault great distances. You can jump your
full Move rating as a Move action, crossing the full distance horizontally or up to half the distance vertically. You subtract your Move
rating from fall distance for damage calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Feral Prowess:</strong> This form has an augmented degree of speed,
strength, or hardiness. For this form, pick either Strength, Dexterity,
or Constitution; that attribute modifier is improved by +1 in this form,
to a maximum of +2. These alterations are obvious and extreme; it is
impossible to masquerade as a normal baseline human if using this art.
Hit points gained from Con improvements are lost when shifting back.</p>
<p><strong>Intrinsic Armor:</strong> This shape has tough scales, hide, shell, or other
defensive integuments. Your base Armor Class is 14 plus half your
character level, rounded down. This AC can be modified by your
Dexterity modifier, and by shields if the shape can hold one.</p>
<p><strong>Manifest Wings:</strong> This shape can form usable wings. You can’t effectively attack while concentrating on remaining aloft, but you can
fly at your normal movement rate +10’ per action. If unhindered and
flying overland you can travel up to ten miles an hour and fly up to
five hours a day.</p>
<p><strong>Octopus’ Embrace:</strong> This shape can have more than four usable
limbs. These additional tentacles, arms, legs, or grippers can hold and
manipulate things; up to four Stowed objects can be held Ready by
these limbs without counting against your Readied Encumbrance limit.
These extra limbs cannot effectively employ extra shields, perform
additional attacks or actions, or do other things that require significant
focus beyond your current action.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect Mimicry:</strong> This alternate form can exactly duplicate another
creature, provided you either have a lock of their hair, a still-liquid
drop of their blood, or ten minutes of observation of them from within
five feet. Once learned, you need no further samples.</p>
<p><strong>Pliant Flesh:</strong> You’ve mastered your shapeshifting skills, and Change
Form can be used as an On Turn action, albeit only once per round.
Alternately, it can take as long as a minute but cost no Effort. Whenever you spend Effort to shift shape, you heal lost hit points equal
to 1d6 plus your level; this does not apply when merely reverting a
form’s change. This art is intrinsic to you, and doesn’t count against
the total number of arts allowed to apply to a form.</p>
<p><strong>Savage Talons:</strong> This shape has extremely dangerous claws, fangs,
pincers, or other body weapons. At first level these weapons do 1d8
damage, use either Str or Dex as the modifying attribute, Punch as
the combat skill, and have a Shock value of 2/AC 13. At level 3 the
damage and Shock increase by +1, at level 6 they increase to +2,
and at level 9 they increase to +3. These weapons can harm even
creatures immune to non-magical weaponry.</p>
<p><strong>Sculptor’s Beauty:</strong> You’ve developed a refined aesthetic sense
that can directly appeal to the subconscious beauty preferences of
viewers. This shape improves your Charisma modifier by +1, to a maximum of +2. There is always something alien about this beauty,
and such forms can never be mistaken for an entirely normal human
or animal, though they may be taken for some exotic demihuman
or altered baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Serpent’s Kiss:</strong> This shape can exude a venom on its claws or fangs.
Successful hits allow you to Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant
action to inflict an additional 1d8 damage plus your Survive skill. You
can elect to make the toxin paralytic rather than fatal; foes reduced
to zero hit points by such a blow are paralyzed and helpless for an
hour rather than mortally wounded.</p>
<p><strong>The Monkey’s Road:</strong> This shape has an arboreal agility when it
comes to climbing. You can travel up sheer surfaces at your usual
movement rate provided at least three limbs are available for use
and the surface is not glassily smooth. If you fall, you can halt your
plunge without damage so long as a serviceable surface to cling to
is within ten feet of you.</p>
<p><strong>Warform:</strong> You gain a flat +2 bonus to all melee hit rolls in this shape
and can use your form hit bonus even in a humanoid body. This shape
is blatantly martial in appearance, however, and cannot pass as
anything harmless or wholly human.</p>
<p><strong>Wisdom of Fin and Scale:</strong> This shape can breathe water, swim
at double your usual Move rate, and is impervious to any normal
climatic extreme of cold or undersea pressure. It can see up to sixty
feet while underwater even in the absence of normal light.</p>
<h2 id="the-thought-noble"><a class="header" href="#the-thought-noble">The Thought Noble</a></h2>
<p>This partial Mage class allows a PC to subtly manipulate the
thoughts of others and control their own mind and body’s operation.</p>
<h3 id="thought-noble-benefits"><a class="header" href="#thought-noble-benefits">Thought Noble Benefits</a></h3>
<p>A Thought Noble exists only as a partial Mage class, to be
taken by an Adventurer alongside another partial class. A Partial
Warrior/Thought Noble might be a cunning duelist who chooses his
enemies with uncanny foreknowledge, while a Partial High Mage/
Thought Noble might be an arcanist who has managed to unearth
the secrets of these psychic arts in the course of their own studies.</p>
<p>All Thought Nobles gain Notice as a bonus skill, acquiring it at
level-0, or level-1 if they already have it at level-0. An ability to
clearly sense perceptual inputs is fundamental to a Thought Noble’s
training, and it is all but impossible to make sense of foreign mental
inputs without a disciplined and trained sensorium.</p>
<p>Thought Nobles do not cast spells. Instead, they develop various
cognitive and telepathic abilities based on the focus of their studies.</p>
<h3 id="thought-noble-arts"><a class="header" href="#thought-noble-arts">Thought Noble Arts</a></h3>
<p>Thought Noble Effort is calculated with Notice rather than Magic,
with each PC’s maximum being equal to their Notice skill level plus
the better of their Intelligence or Wisdom modifiers, to a minimum
of one point.</p>
<p>All Thought Nobles are trained in the <strong>Open Mind</strong> art, but may
develop other techniques with time. If an art allows a saving throw
to resist it, success renders the target immune to that art for the rest
of the scene. Thought Noble arts are all entirely invisible to any but
magical senses and provide no hint as to who is using them, even
on a successful Mental saving throw.</p>
<p><strong>Open Mind:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While Effort
remains Committed, you may detect the current emotional state of
a visible living creature as a Main Action. This discernment isn’t fine
enough to identify the object of their emotions unless it’s obvious
from the context.</p>

<p><strong>Block Memory:</strong> Target a visible living creature and Commit Effort
for the day as a Main Action while specifying a particular event or
situation that didn’t extend longer than a scene. The target gets a
Mental saving throw; on a failure, they simply cannot remember the
event and will construct a plausible false memory to paper over the
gap. The memory can be restored by use of this power once more
or a magical dispelling ability, but detecting the alteration is difficult;
any power that detects enchantments on a target does so with a
+2 difficulty penalty to any skill check made to discern the ban.</p>
<p><strong>Elicitation of Truth:</strong> This art can only be taken by those who have
mastered Surface Apprehension. It can only be used on a helpless
or cooperative target; the Thought Noble may Commit Effort for
the day and ask the target a question that takes no more than two
sentences to ask. If the target fails a Mental saving throw, they must
fully and completely answer the question. They need not exercise
any personal judgment or speculation, but they must answer directly
and without conscious deception.</p>
<p><strong>Facile Speech:</strong> An improvement to the Far Speech art, you may
now nominate up to a half-dozen companions to be favored targets
for Far Speech. You may link with a favored target as an On Turn
action without Committing Effort. The range to contact a favored
target is one mile per Thought Noble level. You can change your nominated companions with an hour’s meditation in the new companion’s presence.</p>
<p><strong>Far Speech:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action and
target an intelligent creature known to you that is within two hundred
feet per level. If they consent, you forge a telepathic link with them that
can convey thoughts, speech, and images even without a common
language. The link lasts for the rest of the scene. While linked with
someone, both of you may reroll failed Mental saving throws and
neither of you can be surprised unless both are.</p>
<p><strong>Hypercognition:</strong> You can drive your mind to tremendous feats of
calculation, estimation, and recall. You have an eidetic memory and
can perform extremely advanced calculations in your head. As an Instant action, Commit Effort for the day and reroll any failed Int-based
skill check. This ability can be used only once on any given check.</p>
<p><strong>Iconograph:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action and target a visible written text, piece of sculpture, iconographic symbol, or
other visible artifact. You receive a short description of the message
or idea the maker was trying to convey with the object. Optionally,
you may use this art when making a sigil, art object, or text of your
own; any valid target will automatically understand your intended
message when they see the item. You may restrict your audience to
particular people or types if you wish.</p>
<p><strong>Impress Imperative:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action
while targeting a visible living creature. You may give it an overwhelming urge to perform some action that takes no longer than a
round and is not completely contrary to its nature or wishes. It can
make a Mental save to resist, but on a failure it spends its next action
carrying out the imperative.</p>
<p><strong>Mind Light:</strong> Your Open Mind art is enhanced. While active, you
become aware of the location of all living minds within sixty feet
of you provided there isn’t a physical barrier between you and the
subject and they are not actively hiding from you. You can identify
the species of these minds, if the species is known to you, any strong
emotional states, and can recognize known individuals. While Open
Mind is active you cannot be surprised by a living creature.</p>
<p><strong>Mind Over Matter:</strong> Your mental control over your physical processes is considerable. Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to</p>
<p><strong>gain one of the following benefits:</strong> automatically stabilize if Mortally
Wounded, go without sleep for twenty-four hours, heal 1d6 hit points
of damage you’ve suffered, or completely ignore normal climatic
extremes of heat or cold for one day. Similar tricks of bodily control
may be allowed at the GM’s discretion.</p>
<p><strong>Mirror Mask:</strong> You become instantly aware of any mind-affecting
power directed at you and can identify the user if they’re within your
current sensory range. You may reroll any Mental saving throw the
attacking ability allows you; if it doesn’t allow a save, you get a single
Mental save to resist anyway. If you succeed, you may Commit Effort
for the day as an Instant action to give the power false information
of your choice or a false impression of success.</p>
<p><strong>Positive Association:</strong> As a Main Action, Commit Effort for the day
and target a visible sentient creature. It gets a Mental saving throw
to resist; on a failure, any thought of you or your actions is suffused
by a glow of benign happiness and admiration. They will treat you
as an admired friend and find all your actions to be eminently reasonable and wise until you or your allies attack them, bring harm
to something they love, or leave their presence for more than an
hour. Affected creatures that were not misused are unlikely to think
themselves bespelled when this power ends unless given reason to.
This ability can affect only one target at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Read Intent:</strong> As an Instant action, Commit Effort for the scene and target a visible living creature. It gets a Mental saving throw to resist;
on a failure, the GM will tell you exactly what it is currently intending
to do on its next turn, or its next relevant action if used out of combat.
If you perform a Total Defense action this round, your insight into its
motions ensures that no attack it makes that you could theoretically
physically avoid can hit you for the rest of the round.</p>
<p><strong>Surface Apprehension:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as a Main
Action while targeting a visible living creature. If it fails a Mental
saving throw, you become aware of its immediate surface thoughts
for the rest of the round. If you ask specific questions of the creature
during this round it will instinctively think of the answers, though the
detail of these surface thoughts is generally limited to one or two
sentences of information.</p>
<p><strong>Thoughts Like Razors:</strong> As a Main Action, Commit Effort for the day
to launch a psychic assault on any visible living creature within sixty
feet. The target gets a Mental saving throw to resist; on a failure, it
takes 1d8 damage per level of the Thought Noble. The damage can
knock it unconscious but cannot kill. On a successful save, the Thought
Noble is stunned by the backlash, taking one quarter of the damage,
rounded down, and losing their next turn’s actions. This ability can
be used only once per scene.</p>
<p><strong>Unthinkable Thought:</strong> Target a visible living creature and Commit
Effort for the day as a Main Action while specifying a particular
person, object, or situation that is currently ongoing in their presence.
The target may make a Mental save to resist; on a failure, they simply
cannot consciously acknowledge the existence of the subject or its
actions unless ignoring it would obviously put their life at risk. This
forced ignorance lasts for up to a scene; at its end, the target will
have no memory of the subject.</p>
<h2 id="the-vowed"><a class="header" href="#the-vowed">The Vowed</a></h2>
<p>Adepts of fist and bodily discipline, the Vowed are a partial Mage
class dedicated to unarmed combat, physical training, and mental
discipline.</p>
<h3 id="vowed-benefits"><a class="header" href="#vowed-benefits">Vowed Benefits</a></h3>
<p>The Vowed class exists only as a partial Mage class, to be taken
by an Adventurer along with another partial class. Thus, a Partial
Warrior/Partial Vowed might be a hardened temple warrior-monk,
a Partial Expert/Partial Vowed might be a sage teacher of religious
or philosophical truths, and a Partial Elementalist/Partial Vowed
might be a mountain sage who wields the elemental forces of nature.
Regardless of classes, a Vowed’s hit dice can’t be worse than 1d6
per level thanks to <strong>Martial Style</strong>.</p>
<p>All Vowed gain a non-combat bonus skill appropriate to their
order, acquiring it at level-0, or level-1 if they already have it at
level-0. Orders that focus on physical training might grant Exert,
while scholarly ones might give Know, religious ones Pray, or occult
sects grant Magic. You may pick whatever non-combat skill suits
your order, assuming the GM finds it reasonable.</p>
<p>Vowed do not learn how to cast spells. Instead, they refine their
inner powers and physical capabilities. These arts are too precise
and delicate to bear the encumbrance of heavy clothing, armor,
or shields, and cannot be used when so burdened. The <strong>Armored Magic</strong> Focus can mitigate this, but Vowed are all trained in effective
unarmored defense techniques.</p>
<p>At first level, a Vowed gains the <strong>Martial Style</strong>, <strong>Unarmed Might</strong>,
and <strong>Unarmored Defense</strong> arts, in addition to one more art of their
choice as given on the adjacent list. Further advancement will grant
additional arts.</p>
<h3 id="vowed-arts"><a class="header" href="#vowed-arts">Vowed Arts</a></h3>
<p>Vowed Effort is based on the skill they chose to represent their
order’s main focus of study, whether Exert, Know, Magic, Pray, or
some more esoteric skill.</p>
<p>Their maximum Vowed Effort is equal to this skill level plus their
best attribute modifier, whatever it may be, to a minimum of one
point. All Vowed automatically gain the Martial Style, Unarmed
Might, and Unarmored Defense arts as part of their training.</p>
<p><strong>Martial Style:</strong> Regardless of class, your hit die can’t be worse than
1d6 per level. When attacking with the Punch skill, your class hit
bonus can be no worse than that of an Expert of your same character level. At third level, any attack using the Punch skill counts
as a magic weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmed Might:</strong> Your unarmed attack damage increases as you
gain levels, as noted on the chart. You may add your Punch skill
to the damage done by these attacks as usual, but Foci such as
Unarmed Combatant that replace or improve your usual Punch
damage do not apply to you.</p>
<p><strong>Unarmored Defense:</strong> When not wearing armor or using a shield,
your base Armor Class is equal to 13 plus half your character level,
rounded down.</p>

<p><strong>Brutal Counter:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action
after resolving an enemy melee attack against you, whether it hits or
misses. You may make a free physical attack against your assailant,
using either a normal attack or some other offensive ability that takes no more than one Main Action to execute. You cannot use
this art more than once per any given attack, but you may use it
while performing a Total Defense.</p>
<p><strong>Faultless Awareness:</strong> Your awareness is such that you cannot
be surprised, and will even wake from a sound sleep in time to
respond normally to some imminent peril.</p>
<p><strong>Hurling Throw:</strong> After you make a successful attack, you may
Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action. The target must
make a Physical saving throw or be thrown up to ten feet in any
direction, falling prone on landing and suffering the damage rolled
for your attack. If the Physical save is successful, the target simply
takes damage as normal. This art can be used only once per round
on any given target, and the target must be no larger than an ox.</p>
<p><strong>The Inward Eye:</strong> Commit Effort as an On Turn action. For as long
as it remains Committed, you are mystically aware of your surroundings with a sense equivalent to normal eyesight regardless
of darkness, obscuring mists, or your actual eyes being closed or
blinded.</p>
<p><strong>Leap of the Heavens:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as a Move
action to leap up to your full Move action horizontally or half that
vertically. You may also Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant
action to negate falling damage, no matter the distance.</p>
<p><strong>Master’s Vigor:</strong> Your body retains its vigor and youthful vitality to
the full normal span of your life. You regain two lost hit points per
hour due to your natural restorative powers.</p>
<p><strong>Mob Justice:</strong> As an Instant action, Commit Effort for the day to become impervious to the Make a Swarm Attack maneuver. Your assailants cannot use this maneuver against you for the rest of the scene,
and you become immune to Shock as long as you remain in melee
with at least two foes. Making use of this benefit disrupts any spellcasting you may attempt, however, due to the violent motion required.</p>
<p><strong>Nimble Ascent:</strong> Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action.
For the remainder of the scene you may move up vertical and overhanging surfaces and across difficult terrain at your full movement
rate with no chance of slipping or falling, provided the surface is not
glass-smooth or enchanted. You require only one free hand to cling
to a wall or ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Purified Body:</strong> You may Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to cure any disease or poison currently affecting you, or instead
to negate any need for sleep, food, water, or air for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Revivifying Breath:</strong> Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action
to heal yourself for 1d6 hit points plus your level. This healing does
not increase System Strain. This ability may be used on your turn even
when you are at zero hit points, but in such a case it Commits all your
remaining Effort for the day. This art can be used once per scene.</p>
<p><strong>Shattering Strike:</strong> Commit Effort for the day and take a full round
of motionlessness to prepare. On the next round, as a Main Action,
your unarmed attack can shatter a wooden door, wooden wall, or
other similar object up to a depth of one foot per level and a width
sufficient to allow a man-sized creature to pass through. At fourth
level this ability improves to affect even a stone wall and at seventh
it can affect even a metal wall or solid iron door. The blow is useless
against a target that can move, but against an immobilized creature
the attack does 1d12 damage per character level.</p>
<p><strong>Style Weaponry:</strong> Pick three general classes of weapons, such as
“swords”, “bows”, “axes”, “daggers”, or the like. When using weapons of those classes, you may use Punch for hit rolls instead of Stab
or Shoot. Your Punch skill does not add to the damage done by
these weapons, however, though the benefits of Martial Style apply
to their hit rolls.</p>
<p><strong>Unobtrusive Step:</strong> You not only possess a considerable skill for
disguise and obfuscation, you can become extremely hard to detect.
Once per scene, you may Commit Effort for the day as an Instant
action to reroll a failed Sneak skill check or skill check related to
impersonating someone else.</p>
